0400|Charlie Juliet, Charlie Juliet, Bravo Wimmo, Bravo Wimmo, checking in after checking our hours are ours and I'm gonna have a craft change.
0366|really nice balance between a little bit looser but you know it doesn't lose any drive but a little more release feels like a bit more lift as well but yeah just not really I'm really stoked
0372|grinding up some new coffee beans. I'm gonna get nickinated and then fires on. She's roaring. She's, oh actually, she's not roaring right now. She's only powering. I need to replace some logs. And then work. Key back.
0414|Yeah, fucking Nickajew with the crochet absolutely smashed it out of the park on that one. What a good little dude. Um That's fucking sick though you made it made that you made that you get the credit
0399|I really like working with white and I really want to do a big forehand carve today
0164|Friday night, big one in the seat. It's, it's, it's. All the boys are gonna come round with pre-its. It's, it's, it's. Drinking beers, drinking beers. Weh, weh, weh. Chammins, we're having a good time. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, weh. Then we're gonna go sit here. We're gonna go bowling. Fucking tamping, bowling. Smash a few... Smash a few...
0170|on the kind of end of it and it just happens that sometimes it does that and it's quite difficult because you know when you're trying to do that thing and then especially when the kind of tide is doing that and then you've got the backwash and the kind of putting it up there.
0158|I've already done two in hours 15. I'm about to lock in for a mega fucking woofing session on the keyboard because work keeps deciding that I can't wind down just yet even though I decided I was trying to wind down fucking two weeks ago.
0010|of Oaks Beach from the road off to Gaff. Jesus Christ, it's windy. Holy smokes. But I'm frothing. I'm absolutely frothing. Sydney's just.
0004|I mean, uh.
0038|I can't wait to fucking click on it as well. Um, yeah, I've been, I'm looking forward to that. I've just not been managing my time very well. And it's that weird thing of like.
0212|So the only option to progress this is on the weekend, so I got a car, I'm just gonna rock up to Contra's S-Rite with the board bug right and then see what they say.
0206|For dinner, perhaps. After a surf later. I don't want to overstep inside your humble shed. You know what I mean?
0207|I don't know what you're talking about. I mean in fairness, Rocky Leves like did look better but there's like ten guys in it and graveyard was empty and like fair some of them were burgers but on like quite a lot of them it's like proper inside bowl and you could just
0213|there because there's no way it's $500 fucking dollars. And then if it is, then obviously, perhaps we're about to plan B, C or D. My preference being on D.
0039|You know when you don't have any set amount of time to do work work So then I just don't I don't know like I'll end up working like now I've worked until 10 to 7 and
0005|Just surfed Bad Beach with Sydney. Waste high. Jubbly drop. Might have to try and get a little stampy wampy on the passport.
0011|send me a message saying Fitz was small and super windy so f***ing keen! Woohoo! F*** sake man, oh I'm meant to have afternoons and that you know what I mean.
0159|So we'll see how that goes if I can see little skywags.
0171|It's kind of pretty difficult I can imagine to continue doing that now. So yeah brother just returned from the surf he said it was fucking waste time, windy as fuck so I'm gonna go and check it. Yeah you're right it was chuffing yesterday and we
0165|fucking frames out, couple swazzy ones, couple strikes, couple spares, you know, this and that. Then we're hitting the big fucking karaoke bar, laying down some of the hardest tracks man man's ever seen, you know? And then we're gonna hit the city.
0398|people. And there's a few coming into graveyards like head high, pretty clean offshore. I don't know what was about the fucking wave wind ratios that was kind of misaligned. But I think I'm gonna go for the walkie walk, where I'm to walkie weft walkie whites, because
0373|f**king stent road bang bang f**k sorry intermission cut to music cut to music
0415|I like that a lot and I'm wondering if that can just do the whole with enough prompts just create the whole template for the website so I don't have to draw up in Canva because Canva is a prick.
0401|Upon the observations I'll be using the BW004 equipped with FB1, FCS2, MB, L, L. FB2 is going to be...
0367|normally psyched which is i don't know what's up because like normally on a given day if i've had a fucking stretch done some work gone out got two tubes and banged it a few times with a new fin
0417|The phone line is back up and operational temporarily. It's been an absolute clusterfuck. Quick alignment. Stoked to hear you absolutely bang the fucking fjazzle out of it today. Very stoked for you. Absolutely frothing.

0013|Beetroot in salad. Do you need to cook it or do you just cut the bitch up?
0205|about life. Also, side note, not really a side note, do you have any things about me having a guest over?

0204|You should definitely not spend the whole day programming on your anniversary as well. I can't imagine Nicole would be too impressed with that. Maybe you should go outside together, or eat some food together, like a dinner, and have a conversation.
0012|So, a lineman, short and sweet, the surf was WUBWUUT!
0006|Whatty whatty, woo woo!
0199|right in the source, I was getting lost in the source, I was fucking showering it, bathing myself, lathering that fucking soap, washing my hair, come out the source, fucking big break of the line, right down to the bottom, see the section and just BAM!
0166|turn see what's whiffing around see what's sniffing see what's whiffing and uh and then yeah Saturday probably feel pretty sorry for ourselves and I'm not gonna tell you how I'm feeling Saturday so you don't even get the opportunity to rub it my face and arm all over like I did to you so yeah so I can have a

0377|Charlie Juliet, Charlie Juliet, Bravo Wimel, Bravo Wimel, all received. You've had a nice mobility stretch this morning. You are caffeinated.
0388|precipitation per hour with periods of intense rainfall frequented throughout the day. Comedially speaking we have a mean wave direction heading of around
0149|Fuck me! I don't know why your dad was shitting on it so much, it was actually well fun. It was like overhead and then you could do like, have like this inside kind of bowl-y section and you could fucking wrap it and like, I was fucking, so many ways.
0161|and three dogs. It's our second brother's birthday today so the boys are going to be coming around, should be about six, seven of us. Playing some pool, drinking some beers, low carb beers only, 87 calories per bottle.
0175|still available no don't do it don't do it oh my god don't do it stop um uh yeah i land uh
0029|like wow I'll actually fucking in disbelief how quickly I've just managed to fucking do that work
0015|I'm not shouting it, but I'm human, so I put it in the bin. Or the compost, actually, for some worms to enjoy. Maybe worms like the beetroot. Venison, Charlie Juliet approved, though. Just had a banging salad. I'm talking...
0001|There's actually the exact same flight but arriving Sunday morning instead of Monday morning. So I don't know, it's up to you if you want to...
0217|I didn't realize how fucking bad it was but like I ran out of gum and snus and I'm not gonna buy anymore but like I'd have a ciggy and like as soon as I fucking I put it out I'm like fuck.
0203|Of the air and the fucking humidity kind of made it like that thing and over time just like it just kind of thing that You know what I mean?
0202|The old titty mountains all covered up in clouds so I couldn't line myself up with it. And then the thing did that thing and the thing was kind of thinging around and the kind of pressure.
0216|It must be months that I didn't have any Niki gum or snus. And fuck me, I am so fucking addicted to nicotine. It's insane.
0014|I'm raw, raw beach on a goody. I know like you. I don't know if you meant to eat it like that, but I cut some up and I had a fucking Nibbzki, little rabbit. Nyeh meh meh meh meh meh meh. Um, if I was a rabbit, I would have spat it out.
0028|Fuck that noise. That sounds like such a headache. In other news, holy fucking shit. I love CLI.
0174|here to fill English breakfast. We made steak tacos. We played some pool, had a few swirls. Pretty chill, pretty mellow. Tonight's gonna get absolutely head kicked through the fucking door. Absolutely swanked on bunk, off the top row.
0160|But yeah, a bit more of an alignment I guess. So obviously you know, man's always landing on his feet and that. So I got here and mate went away, we're standing in the gas. So I got his car and his room.
0148|Ended up um, drop your rents off and then went and surfed To the right of the groin at low tide, I don't know what white ease What's something I don't know? I don't know what's good
0389|225 degrees with a average wind heading of 175 degrees given a relative angle of 90.
0410|please in terms of job application interview.
0376|out. We'll probably pre-align, align after post-align morning alignment for the mid-morning alignment but pre-mid morning because it'll be pre-surf alignment.
0362|Left right center emails boop boop like an AK Midday some leftover curry I made last night real nice Snapper curry fresh snapper was good. Yummy. Yum. Yum. Yum
0404|Welcome to the chain. Whee!
0305|there you could argue.
0311|Hey mate, um, pre-alignment, alignment, pre-alignment, claying in, claying in, check, check, check, heading down the coast, down the coast, had a super fucking unproductive morning, fuck yeah, productivity through the floor, it's-
0339|on that side of Australia and this could be a good opportunity to get it close and that would work around something like me taking obviously I take a board bag with my boards and then
0107|And they didn't say anything, didn't ask anything, which I was quite surprised about. So that's pretty jokes. And then now I'm heading down the coast with Corbin. We're not with him, he's not in the car.
0113|Now it's 8am, I'm going home to realign my chakras, I'm going to yoga for stiff people and then hitting down the coast. SW trying to convince me to surf back beach with her. Fuck that! I want to surf some fucking proper waves. So I headed.
0073|And then I was like, yeah, why she has that? And then I did. And then Sydney was I'm not really sure. But apparently he's just speaking about shit. And when we said for
0067|I'm fucking sucking them nipples. We're about to make some business. Business is booming. And that's, you know, real excited to hear that you're gonna go surfing because I'm on my way to surf number seven of the week. Oh yeah.
0098|like a sweet spot. So the sweet spot of the back foot was changing on the turn type, always changing the turn type because that finish was a bit looser, which is really interesting. And then I put it up there on an inside and last section back in.
0271|Um, Nicole crochet hobby. Fuck yeah. We're getting some my brother. Stoked for you. Um, does does Sydney hunt? Put it this way.
0265|Um, fudger, stoked that you had a sick one of Talos. I'm a little bit jealous because I went to Sten Road this morning and I fucking bitched it. It was that cold. It was like waist high, pretty sm-
0259|enjoy each other's company and have a good time and hang out and hang out the back of it simultaneously so I would say neither although probably more I know I wouldn't say exploit I was gonna say more leaning towards exploring
0258|Yeah, Maricopa. It might be, could be on. Seems like a pretty sick spot and falling in love or exploiting. Very black and white there Benjamin. Can two people not just
0264|So yeah, that's still an option, I can always do that. So, I'll keep the post. Pun, mine, pun, intentional. Whoa!
0270|But yeah, what about the doobba?
0099|and put it up there. I was like pretty stoked in that favorite time of the surf.
0066|tangible output of what we've done so far. You may be slightly disappointed, but we don't have a GM. And as you just said, you the back end with fucking Claude, me and Gemini fucking slapping the tits out the front end. You clapping them cheeks.
0072|on the road with work and whatever and then apparently Ari asked Sydney if you Ben had broken up with your girlfriend yet
0112|on some Mendy with BJ. However JC was hanging at the back of it last night with SW so yeah. Fuck yeah!
0106|I said I went up the coast last weekend with a mate and then they were like, oh where did you stay? At their parents place. I was like, oh yeah. Then I stayed at her grandparents with the grandad.
0338|we have an alignment meeting regarding surfboards because I have a little sniff from based off a meeting with my director yesterday that I very well may be moving to Perth in February and at some point I'd like my taco grind
0310|and got a 10 snapper and a couple other things sick yeah and then waves are pumping next week so well tuesday at least so yeah fucking buzzing
0304|Also still no snus, still no chewing gum. Just raw dogging the rollies baby, feeling good about it. Although I'm fucking raw dogging rollies man, yoish. But yeah, making um, making
0312|Monday, you know how we roll. Meant to wake up at five, get some stretching in, in the office by six, six to nine, three hours, bang done, reality check. Fuck him, probably actually only done about 15 minutes of work. Fuck him! Down the coast.
0306|Yep, Clayton in. Wow. Throffing, stoked, buzzing. Vibed out for you there, bro. Wow, best fucking
0110|J.C. in, J.C. in. BJ are you there? BJ are you there? Are you alive BJ? J.C. concerned about BJ's...
0104|Last night, I'm feeling pretty drained in every sense of the word. Got up, lit the fire, stroked with Adrian, did a hip mobility one. Pretty good actually. Pretty good. Did a couple pauses.
0138|moldy capsicum, or like a soft kumara or whatever they're called or like a sprouting onion useless pass your sale by day
0064|But I'll say I use some kind of AI to help me with the process. And fucking Sandy, she's about to get her cheeks clapped. Fuck that bitch, man.
0070|What am I saying? Yeah, so I was fucking hanging out with, hanging out with Sydney. I was hanging out with Sydney last night and then yawning and that and then she
0058|time as I would have spent me coding it myself actually understanding what the fucking code is doing such that when when I get questions I know where shit is and that kind of thing but I've got a pretty good understanding of it I'd say already
0266|Super clean no one out a couple little waves, but it was almost too small because it's like breaking on some little rock but For Dutch Corralio, it was like I swear those eyes on the road is frosty. So the reward was not worth it
0272|You go into her bedroom and she has the skull of a deer, horns and all, or antlers, I don't know what the fuck they are, right above her bed on the headboard up there. So based on that, if I-
0299|And as about said, I don't have any time, but it's fucking that's just not true Benjamin I'm just not prioritizing it and I need to hold myself accountable for that So maybe when I'm back from next week, I'm gonna make a priority, you know sift through And get all the pictures that are on my
0298|doing any clicksting and it's really annoying because I want to post more Instagrams but I need to do like I need to go through my scans on my laptop to actually get some more from SA to post before I start posting about other stuff.
0273|If I was a bedding man, I would place a lot of money on the fact she does hunt. Yeah. But I don't know, I think she goes with someone else. Like she doesn't just fucking off, off she pops into the woods.
0267|So I drove home. But yeah. Blame the tools. Fuck yeah blame the tools. I agree with that 100%. Why do you think I have false earth boards? It's not me. It's the fucking boards. So I keep-
0059|I just need to get a better, broaden my context window in terms of how the functions are being called into one another because that's pretty alien to me and that's why I was, you know, that's why the AI really helped out a lot.
0071|He said that, so Ari and Talia, their other mate, they had dinner together on like Monday or Tuesday night or whatever. And then, because Ari had been away.
0065|I think we've made significant progress for sure. Don't get me wrong. But I feel like if we had a GM and he was reviewing, you know...
0139|You're like a fucking... bit of... bit of firewood that's been left out in the rain. Just soggy and wet. And useless. No one wants you anymore. You're just gonna go back in the ground, and the worms will have you. You can make worm friends.
0105|Out of coffee, was on the blow to rinse for half hour, 40 minutes, good alignment there. First alignment in a fair while. Was telling about my fishing.
0111|on the gear again because BJ no normally do this and BJ do this second time in the last two months very interesting um JC quite jealous JC would love to be absolutely off someone's absolute
0307|bang you've done that's a claim and a half um maricopa fucking unreal place sick time when surfed on the way up yesterday little waist high where do you
0313|Westerlies forecasted onshore onshore back to my roots. This is where jersey men shine We love onshore onshore is what we live for Hopefully it's gonna be about a head high overhead couple onshore just some absolute
0317|Waves were misaligned. Rocks, a lot of rocks at Stent, Stent Wright, more rocks than I've ever encountered before. Very strangely breaking. Couldn't really sit on the inner thing because of the thing with that...
0303|like graphics and fun stuff and I don't want fun I want practical so we'll see how we go with that
0129|Evel was the first time I told her about it. And now she's fucking grinning ear to ear because I just picked her up some premium, premium good goods. Isn't that right Sydney? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, that's what I thought. I'll give you a buzz tomorrow.
0115|Uh oh!
0101|but don't really know why or why not, but that's just what it is. And that is a very interesting business idea. And if I was gonna go into business with someone, it would be you. And I'd be keen to explore possibilities on how we could operate.
0049|And fuck she probably actually build the website And actually fucking just do it But yeah Fucking shit happens shit takes time and you know, that's okay because this is
0061|Fuck it. And because it's all on the CTR, so what I bill my time to is on, essentially, business development. So they didn't fucking check the hours on that shit.
0075|But I don't know what you're telling her. Or if what you're telling her has been misconstrued. Probably about fucking the hobbies.
0263|I'm gonna get myself out of it. I'm gonna rip the f*** out of it. But then whatever, you know, I could just have my twin days. I've got so many stuff, what do you think you're doing, Doug? Yeah, so many. So I'm losing my f***ing marbles.
0277|She's also got fucking like possum pillows, like a couple possum fur pillows, and maybe a possum fur blanket, which I was like, that's, I don't know, she kind of choked on me, she's like, that's possum fur, and I was like, whoa, I don't know.
0288|Goats Peak and then I'm gonna go do some work now. But yeah, strange afternoon. Probably because I'm self in like two days as well. I reckon that's something to do with it.
0289|Yeah, I don't know it was a fucking weird one though because when I got my last paycheck I was like fuck yeah, and looked at my savings. I fuck yeah, I got fucking cash. I'm sorted like my scone after in that and Then I don't know
0276|Yeah, I mean, if you think the dead animal watching is weird, fucking you should have seen the cat. If you go like a little kitten and that fucker was just, you know, again, all the tips and tricks. Um, yeah.
0262|And then there's obviously just still the option of me just bringing it to endo and then whatever Which is yeah fine obviously the subby here, but it's a bit annoying because I was just getting myself psyched to self-destruct
0074|he left together or something. So I don't know if she's got the wrong end of the stick or what but um yeah I thought I was pretty curious because I thought he was pretty good.
0060|So once I get my head around that I should be able to answer the questions. And I've, you know, yeah. And with the wireframe, you know, that's just fun. You know, just a little fucking side quest on a side quest. They didn't answer that shit. I was just like...
0048|coming across new tools, new things to learn about and new areas to improve our development games which is the most important part. Woo woo!
0100|That's nice to hear you spoke to Blazer B. I haven't spoken to my parents since last Tuesday. And not like Tuesday this week, I mean like the Tuesday before I went to Maricopa. Like fucking ages ago.
0114|down the coast after yoga, gonna be mobile, gonna be fucking aligned with myself, gonna be frothy. Nah, I haven't asked to do that about the fins, I haven't looked, I will though. But check check one two out out out out.
0128|It's local isn't it? It doesn't actually matter. Yeah, probably not on the buzzer tonight. But I've just been acquiring some major accusations from Wallys. Sydney was giving me all...
0302|And yeah, I don't know canva it really ain't tickling my pickle not gonna lie to you. It's a bit There's too much like thousand whistles and too much AI shit and too much
0316|Hey mate, f***ing mid afternoon alignment. Yeah, probably a bit too frothed this morning. Yeah, tricky. Let's call it tricky. Tide was low.
0328|see you back in afterwards. Charlie Julia out.
0300|my computer ready for little posty boasties and you know use canvas make a web wireframe kind of shit and actually I was using Canva to make a kind of wireframe flowchart
0314|Park off sections. So we're real alone. Once I'm out of the waves, I've absolutely ripped the bag out of it. We're feeling pumped. We're feeling jammed. We're feeling motivated. Check, check one, two, one, two in the business.
0102|this with the huge caveat that I know fuck all about it but I can speak I reckon sometimes but that could be interesting very interesting indeed
0116|Benjamin, Benjamin January, this is Jay. Just surfed back beach, super small, another tick for the butternose. But I've pretty much been the entire surf.
0076|Not that it matters in any way shape or form anyway. But yeah, I don't know. Interesting.
0062|it's not like we can go budget there's no budget on it so the plan of action from now is to make it all look pretty get me to understand it and then having
0089|Thank you.
0248|heard it's about two but for $277 you'd be able to buy yourself a fucking board you know what I mean so yabba dabba doo
0274|with a gun and comes back with a dare. I think it's like some other people do it with her and she doesn't have a gun, I think. But hopefully some fishing, some surfing and a hunting would be sick.
0260|But I'm not exploiting it all. Um, I feel like I'm being very, very uh, considerate to everything. And fuck yeah I'll go Maricopa, seems like a sick ass spot.
0261|Gosh. Gonna win this competition. Camping.
0275|So yeah, fucking pads to the people, fuck the vegans. Woo woo!
0249|Well that just sounds like a marvellous day doesn't it? I'm unequivocally stoked for you and that is inspiring that you've warmed up your hip flexes. It was the cur-
0088|God, that poke your eye out. Wow. That's unfortunate for him. Yeah, five tangos out of graveyards, pretty small, blowing his tits off. I doubt there'd be anyone at Rocky Road, so I might go check that.
0063|meeting with the software developer guy and the other, and Nick, who you met, to talk him through what I've done. And I'm an open book. I'll tell him I use fucking AI for it. I don't know if I'll say Gemini because I don't want to give them the upper hand, you know?
0077|yeah alignment with a silver Fox will is complete or silver Fox wind flow I'm gonna go check the K patch he reckons it could be
0117|thinking of crystal bit, crystal box, crystal fucking wire, whatever, and the possibilities of it. And I was chatting to Steve at yoga this morning and then he got me thinking about...
0103|Yeah, fucking roger that Tango, roger that. Don't spend your whole weekend clacking away, get outside, do some of Nicole. Mid-morning alignment, AM. Had a pretty good sleep.
0315|Thanks for watching!
0301|this analysis method analysis we have to do that I'm translating from octa to Python because I was getting confused about it and I was getting so lost so I thought you know what I'm gonna map this out I'm gonna make it nice and visual I'm a visual learner
0329|Post surf alignment. Wow. Fuck. That was uh that was something I'll tell you that for free. Yoy. Big junkie. There was literally like waves on the way.
0324|you
0330|and half the time I didn't even know what wave I was surfing. Managed a couple wraps bang on the last one I was fucking thank praise the Lord I'm getting out kind of thing. I was getting dark as well no idea where to sit
0318|kind of system above pushing the peaks kind of in towards that kind of area subsequently had to kind of fang a little bit wider meaning the wave shape was
0126|Might be a walking home in this, right?
0132|You're cracking me up there buddy. I'm fucking so keen for Sydney. Actual northern beaches of Sydney. Fucking frothing to hang out with the boys.
0052|crucially important task to generate a analysis flowchart of the work I've been doing and to do that how am I doing that?
0046|If you looked at it from when we very first started to now, in terms of actual progress, arguably one could potentially say...
0091|but fuck they're a bit like just a frame in not much like actual frame beyond the a but yeah that's fun fucking cold though yeah like in like an hour and a half maybe if you're still
0085|with the cup now is negative double triple A's absolutely fucking blowing blowing off the mountain harder than a Japanese samurai slices of bamboo.
0250|who was and I'm sure you did put it up there put yourself down like that put it up brother jealous yourself and tell us what a wave man geez and and then then then then
0244|$680 Convenient whatever the fuck that means 659 and Coming in hot with economical at a whopping
0278|It was weird now. But primal, I guess. Kind of primal. You got to try new things. You got to put yourself out there.
0293|You know, I'm trying to set up in whatever she's telling me to do and next minute she's moved on to the next one so Yeah, I don't know how I feel about that. I did mobility one. I don't really feel that much. I don't know I'm not like full full mobile. I thought I'd be more
0287|24 hours this week and tomorrow I'm taking a mental health day because we're going to Maricopa. So then I started like getting weird anxiety over something that I know I shouldn't worry about and it was real strange and then I went and f***ing stomped the s*** out of it.
0286|get out until I went on the hike. It was really strange. I think I was weirdly, I was stressing about cash even though I've got more than enough already. So I'm only, I've only done like, um, fuck like
0292|because money comes money goes brother so that was kind of fun and then did some yoga this morning yoga of Adrian online mobility class I'm not really liking this chick I'm not gonna lie I find she moves a bit too quick for me
0279|And about your job. I reckon, I don't know, I reckon you're getting yourself worked up over something that you don't need to get yourself worked up over.
0245|trying to fucking fix this car or figure out this car. Drive you silly fucking car. $277. So yeah, there's a few other options.
0251|was the crew it was skipper Steve and I think Hayden I don't know I think his name was Hayden so you know they knew what they they knew what they were doing and yeah piping the piping is a terrible word Ben
0084|still blown it's absolute fudging tweed off absolute harry swede blown off absolute blown it's bloody tits off absolute was a size
0090|I do, I do, I do, I do. But man's got business to doing that, you know what I'm saying? Just got out of the surf at the groin. Fucking pretty peaky. Those are wet.
0047|There hasn't been a great deal in the last six months potentially, or wherever it's been. However, to me, there's been a fucking huge progress and we keep
0053|What I've done is I've given Gemini CLI a prompt to go into my function and just search everything and generate the prompts for me to copy and paste into another
0133|and I'm pretty content with my time in the Naki coming to an end. I've had a great time and that's all I can ask for. So you're wrong, Mr. fucking...
0127|Now Sydney's whipping up, stay, Chibatties. Yeah, fair enough. Put my report in there.
0319|kind of doing a weird thing on that kind of plane. However, I did wrap a few around pretty solidly on the rail.
0331|coming left right and center real misaligned but yeah for often had a good time I had a real good time people over here don't understand fool me I swear because I'm getting blinded by the lights on this whole drive back which have been pretty
0325|Check, check, check in. This is Charlie Juliet. Charlie Juliet, Region 4, Bravo.
0333|What the um, what's that all about? And it's definitely not Guernsey cows. Guernsey cows, they ain't worth the grass they fucking eat. Uses pieces of shit. Reckon they got Guernsey dairy. They're just fucking copycats. Whatever we do they-
0327|Fuck we're frothing. We are so out there, solo sesh. There's no one in the entire pay or a road, or wherever it's fucking called. We are frothing. We are out there. I'll see you.
0131|Okay, I just want you to know that. One does have fun in the evenings, but nothing in this life is free, Ben, including fun.
0125|Your parents know like me they know pick up and then just went to the garage brings out a battery pack jumper thingy did absolutely fuck all
0119|look like or how it would operate but something like say they're offshore and they can't remember what the operational conditions so how big the sea can be for like an ROV they could just open up crystal bit
0045|Yeah and what I also think is really cool and what I'm really enjoying is that like every couple of weeks something happens with Clixed and even though like
0051|So this morning, I've um, I've self-assigned my ta- my s- uh, what? I've self-assigned myself, I've assigned myself the very, very-
0079|Well, good or not, you've got me absolutely frothing to go surf again. You know, the froth levels kind of dipped this morning temporarily. Can confirm after spending five hours on shit that I didn't need.
0086|dick and a half. It's blowing so hard that if one were to step outside of one's vehicle, one would potentially end up in Australia. It is blowing so hard that I believe
0092|about I became for a alignment Co
0247|you know you could buy I mean I was just gonna pay for shipping anyway but in my head I was gonna rock up and if it was less than two then you know I was just gonna I was gonna do it kind of thing you know my cap was two and as you just
0253|
0284|Yeah, sick. Well that's good then. I'm sure she will serve and support you and beckon to your every demand and bow at your feet. I just marched, no not marched, stomped.
0290|I just started, I think it was more about the hours I'd done that week, even though I don't own my company any hours, but it's just that dark side to the casual worker. That really eats me up in terms of the guilt.
0291|of not doing work even though I don't have to do any work because I'm not contractually employed to do a set number of hours a week. Yeah I don't know I'm sweet so this morning I actually just booked another flight you know.
0285|up to Ghost Peak. Made that thing my bitch. Bit of a weird afternoon actually. For some, like I got fucking super anxious about nothing. It was real weird. For like...
0252|know kind of misogynistic as if they're an object they're not um but yeah you know he gets Ben Webster 650 so fair game if you ask me maybe I'll get a little discount as well
0246|freight companies who are up on the old googly-woogly and have a little quality watchy-suchy watchy but at that price I don't think the um I think the value is there
0093|Well, that's good to hear about yourself. You know, you don't have to put it up there every time. It's good that you got out there. Graveyard wind just full dropped there. It was crazy. But then
0087|The rocks underneath the reef are even moving. Fuck me, it's so windy, holy shit. Few guys out, few tangos out at graveyards, maybe five, six people. Got another fucking, he's got a huge nose, oh my.
0078|be an option for sure worth a look although I mean I'm pretty sure he says that about any wave anytime but yeah fuck it and the mountains looking sexy today baby
0050|a safe space and a productive environment where there's no pressure from the outside world.
0044|time to warm house house called I called
0118|offshore installation vessels and really any offshore rig and the amount of documentation involved in those kind of procedures operations is like insane and using i don't know what the thing
0124|warehouse kind of thing with equipment that adheres to regulations. Fuck! Possibilities are endless. This could be huge. Huge.
0130|Good morning Benjamin. It brings me immense joy, satisfaction, gratitude, appreciation for life that you feel like shit.
0326|you.
0332|hectic. I'm voice knowing for something else and I can't remember what it was. Oh well firstly Jersey cows.
0336|today with the amount of work I've done. So yeah, how's that?
0322|Yeah, today's uh, today ain't a fucking business day, put it that way brother. Yo!
0108|So I won't be sending his voice message if he was, but I'm gonna go meet Corbin, Sydney's brother. So slide a little wave in with him, which will be pretty jokes. Feeling good, need a shit. Life moves, pretty keen, pretty frothy.
0134|I don't know, I can't be asked to insult you because I'm not that kind of guy and my meditations, my yesterday's yoga for stiff people session, the theme of the session was all about compassion and compassion for oneself.
0120|type in you know what what rv's are on board are those rv 004 006 and 009 what is the operational limit like conditions of 004 and then it just comes up and fucking you know provides you the documentation need for that
0068|Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah.
0040|to go get dinner and shit so I won't do any click shit and I could have done clicks earlier but I was kind of just like fucking about with work instead of just bashing it out and like setting myself you know time to do it like I give myself time
0054|tool and I'm setting up a UX pilot account which is an AI wireframing thingy and then I'm going to copy and paste the Gemini output prompts to then put into this UX pilot
0083|surf. Quite disappointed actually in that. But you know we do love a big amount of crab hunting. So that's fun. Update on the old Naki coastline. I'm down in the graveyards now and it's
0097|to have it all the way back because I was finding my back foot would be like all the way on the kicker and I go for a carve and it'd be like too loose but then if I did it with my back foot like a halfway up the deck pad then like it'd be real nice and feel
0242|Shalom, alaikum, alaikum, alaikum, alaikum, alaikum, alaikum, alaikum, alaikum, alaikum, so I've just spoken to a very lovely lady at Qantas Freight and you know I tipped myself
0256|that right now milk the fuck out of it and then bounce and see what happens in the future although I can't really comment because I'm in a very comfortable position so it's not really relatable so I do apologize for that
0281|you set yourself apart because of how much of a genuine personal interest. So I'm just kicking my fucking snapper you have in, in the field. And the only thing you can really do is one, don't worry about something that isn't even confirmed to be.
0295|I don't know how to hack anything apart from a big fat top turn bush Gamma Copa in a few hours. No hunting though Old mate hunter boys not not around this weekend, which is shame. So just gonna be
0294|about after it. But really cool about your pie. This is really cool and I really am enjoying hearing about the piracy you're doing. It's quite inspiring. Can I hack into your pie? Not hack.
0280|You know, your company said to you the other day how fucking indispensable you are. And obviously the market is changing a lot in respect to software developers and stuff. But then I feel like you're different.
0257|I'm sure you'll be sweet. Fucking you're a smart cookie. You can get a job. You can get a job at my work, and we can go live in Mars together, and you can build our software. You're actually probably fucking good, to be fair.
0243|put it on the scales, she got the old measuring tape here, measured up the board, got a little cut ski-wop ski, now express 1100
0096|is when I'm going for a sloppier section carve, I want my front foot, my back foot, sorry, to be on the forward half of the deck on the grip pad. And then when you wanna put it up there.
0082|Um, that is your JS now, brother. Your JS. So don't refer to it as mine ever again. I've passed on the baton.
0055|to fucking do it all for me so I will keep you updated on how it goes Oh Oh Oh Oh UX pilot you want money from me
0041|to go surfing but she'll come.
0069|I'm confidential in conversation now so fucking little dewbags hanging around put your fucking headphones in
0121|And like for literally anything like that on board, you could do all the equipment on the vessels and pretty much any construction site has to be dated and checked every year. So you could have like a, you know.
0135|So thou shall be compassionate in oneself, and extend my compassion to you, good sir. Because it's clear to me that you're so fucking queer that you're-
0109|on the surf not gonna lie to you. Tango out.
0323|Yeah, sorry. I've done this a lot recently. I forget why I'm voice messaging. And it was to say that if I do go check the waves, I'm probably going to miss the alignment meeting. But I'll keep you posted on that.
0337|Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin. Um, quick one while I'm in my head. Um, before you book any body flights.
0309|today, woke up at like seven, Sydney was like do you want to go for a walk up the hill? I was like okay. Fucking absolutely stomped up this mountain motherfucker. Huge. And then went and checked the waves but no dice and then went fishing.
0321|3 o'clock for the last 25 minutes I've just sat on the couch, moped, replenished my lungs and now I think I might have to go check the surf again.
0335|Woohoo! No, not that. No thank you, Monsieur. So I think this, I'm actually gonna have to do some work this week, which is probably a good thing for the account because PNL, I think we're in the negative.
0123|You can get it to send you a fucking report of, okay, what's expiring, what needs to be renewed, what's come to the end of its life kind of thing. And that would be useful in literally any construction site, any fucking.
0137|yeah? Fucking wanker. Pig. Fucking... Krusty... Pork rind. Fucking...
0057|Yeah, yeah, you make a pretty valid point there buddy. The goal, I guess, the way to combat that is for me to now spend an equal amount of
0043|You can guess why Cold Still sat in the car after arriving at the house Because car has heater House no heater House need make fire Fire take
0094|there was like fucking 15-20 people like stupid amount so I was sat on the right for most of it and I get like five rides and then I'd go to the left and catch the set and then I'd paddle on the inside sit get like two rides and
0080|to spend five hours on because I just wanted to do it. And when I told you that I was gonna close Gemini, I didn't close Gemini. No, no, no, I carried on doing other shit I didn't need to do. Buh-buh!
0269|fucking top turn and it was like I just two pokes on the eyes and just hit straight eyeball all squidge no cranium no skull so that was that reference
0255|excited to speak to me. It's almost like he didn't have his own son. I think he was way more excited to speak to me than he was you. Job. Yeah, fuck the job. Fucking take him for the-
0241|I don't fudge and tired and then I've got me five and means to Oh fudge six to late fudging hard to fudge say fudge. I don't know if I like this
0296|now with Sydney and the granddad. Meeting the family already brother, two weeks in. That's how we do it. Ain't no time like the present, no time to lose.
0282|happening and two, be proactive about it. And if you are like generally concerned that your job might not be lasting longer, then just start casually looking around for like other solutions. But we absolutely.
0283|ain't gonna fucking do is have a shit moody time when you're away because you're worried about the real fucking world. All right? Meh.
0297|Getting a little bit A little bit pissed off about like I keep working keep getting meetings and evenings And then I just keep um Not being not prioritizing
0240|he's getting the passport stamp and now come on trim ear off on teams measure me and he's like can we have a call and I'm like meh no just do what you thinks best and then I'll tell you if it's right and
0254|Yeah, man, that's no worries. If you want to be that insecure about the relationship with your father, that's fine. Yeah, that's your problem. That's not my problem. Scott and I had a lovely conversation. Thank you very much. He was so nice.
0268|getting a new one to mask the fact I'm shy. And cranium, I think I was, the cranium is your Jed, your head. And I think I was talking about how I just absolutely clinical precision bang the tits off.
0081|So, and then we're gonna go check the waves again. Bye!
0095|and then paddle over and get a set on the left. And I was being a bit of a dog like that, but it worked pretty well. And the right, so you just do literally just one cutback and that was it. But what I have found with this fin and which I'm really keen to investigate more is...
0042|What were check out that down going down It is morning time I'm not feeling well rested
0056|off and we use a different one okay okay I'll keep you updated whimsical join for free that sounds good
0136|Pending up your frustration and Incompassion and expressing it on others So maybe you should look in the mirror Little sad crybaby boy
0122|you upload all of your equipment specifications and the date of last review, which would be on the check sheet or whatever it is, put them all into the model and then every month
0334|just do way worse. Guernsey Dairies, silly cows over there. Fucking hell. And then, oh yeah, so just driving back, checking my emails and I've had like four emails about like new projects and like loads of work coming in and I'm just there like, whoo!
0320|Um, didn't start doing any work till the one o'clock meeting. Um, was in meetings from one to let's call it two 30 did some photo editing during those meetings. It's now.
0308|wave. Wild fun on the twin blade. Fucking did the railing though. Like shinned it when I was trying to bang it but I did bang the fuck out of it on a few before it and then went around to that friend's place yesterday. Fucking wild fun. And then
0421|pretty frothing on that. Picking up some some future fins tomorrow for the TACO grinder.
0347|of you there bud. Cyd is messaging me saying she was on her time of the month so that's pretty fucking buzzing there's no baby J coming because yeah pretty questionable put out game.
0353|see how illegal I can do this and not pay them a cent. Although reviewing my pay slips, I do think they may potentially have some grounds to stand on, given I only paid 14K in taxes.
0409|And then what's the status update on Nicker Fuck what's the call second name Nickerju status update on Nickerju
0384|Post wake up, pre surf alignment complete. Charlie Juliette out.
0390|5 degrees hence when we normalize by MWD we're looking at a Hello, that was a nice one. Oh, sorry. I'm in my report. We're looking at a wave wind
0145|beautiful sunrise here this morning light variable offshores good bit of swell my friend reckons me a head high overhead so we're gonna go for a nice surf together at 9 9 30 in the morning brother's birthday tomorrow he's getting the

0179|Like, way too much. Like a young instructor, young people in the room, fucking Luli Lemming, good law. Not worths. It was just fucking a bit much. It was a bit too like... Ah, now you can stretch out your heart. Fuck off. I'm here to get limber. Yeah, not be a good person. Do you know what I mean?

0025|The thing's about to turn up, but obviously no one's meant to turn up. And then like two seconds later, like the door, the main door, like clicks, kind of like closed or like, you know, you made a sound.
0019|Fuck it was it was kind of doing it just getting blown off harder than a slit eye and a tight brothel. But fuck I had some shape. A few sick ones.
0233|and then just transform all to the back foot, letting your weight fucking turn the bottom turn, fucking, and then just up to the top and bang! You know, just fuck off. Take that one, you fucking gunsy little cow, you fucking milk shit. Do you know what I mean?
0227|But yeah, feeling pretty mellow and then did look into a fucking productive four hour session. Productivity was almost exceptional. Let's do the roof almost actually. It was. Yeah, it was. And now I'm at Graveyard. It's about... It's about...
0226|Coffee on, stretch done, yoga with Adrian. Did some fucking flow one. She's a bit quick. Fucking absolutely ramster. I'm like, fuck it, hold on a minute. Let me get my fucking set up and then she's moving on. You know what I mean?

0024|I got in the window, caught my eye, and it was like someone had arrived. I didn't see anyone or anything, but it was kind of that, I don't know, I got that feeling like, oh.
0030|I can't fucking believe that. It's insane. And it's so crazy. And like the ability for it to run the um, run the script and then
0193|Fuck yeah. Yoga this morning was fucking class. Loved it. It was me and like six fucking mums and dads. It was great. Steve and Nick were there. Went for a coffee with them after. Got the full

0391|ratio of about 0.45 which isn't very aligned in terms of wave height we've got roughly one and a half times the average human being provided they're not wearing air forces

0352|Do they not know who I am? This is not how this arrangement works buddy. Mr ATO, you pay me. I ain't giving you a dime. So I'm going to investigate that with a registered tax official.

0393|tangos. We've got one tango out on a right coming into the Maldi boat ramp area which is really strange and zero tangos at G's Graveyard.
0387|atmospheric we're sitting around 1,100 bar pressure, foul cover hovering around the 0.65 region expecting to drop we have on average 5 millimetres
0152|WAH!
0146|absolute fucking presence from the Lord himself. Lord Morpheus is gonna morph sand the endless dreamer, wherever the fuck he calls himself. Been bashing out on the plane.
0191|And listening back to those voice messages, I admit I do sound maybe perhaps a little two-legged feathery bird which cockadoodledoos. Fair enough. But fuck you.
0185|20 seconds? What? 20? How the fuck do you do that? That's insane. I've never actually made it fucking inside.
0026|I swiveled round so quick and like full heart drop. Oh, oh that was cooked. Shout at myself, oh my days. Oh I better take a smoke oh, fuck.
0032|Oh, I fucking love computers, man. Holy shit. Wow. And yeah, I did just bang out an extra fucking probably. What did I put in the sheet? Oh, I put an extra hour that I didn't do.
0224|Fuck all crazy. I hate Mondays. So I think I'm gonna go surf
0230|Brizzi Barley still to 50 bucks. So I booked that later. And how's the old visa situation? This is coach Clayton out.
0218|This is when the gumball, the snus would usually go in. And like fucking hell, it's cooked. So I'm stopping that and just gonna go back to the hard stuff. Back to the rollies, maybe ease out of them. I didn't have a fucking rollie.
0219|Any nicotine from like Fuck it would have been like half full onwards. She's pretty impressive for me. So I'm pretty stoked on that So maybe by Mexico, I'll only be having like 10 rolls a day fucking pretty good going
0231|Fuckin' love surfing. Wow. Pretty slow. Pretty fuckin' slow. Sets were only like, well, to be fair the bigger sets were like chest-head-high. And fuckin' put it up there in a few of them. Fuck.

0033|which is probably a fucking skimping it a bit probably should put an extra two hours down fuck me wow so stoked on that and I was using flash for the last hour or so and it seemed to be doing all right but it kept on
0027|Also, I don't know what a task board is or how to send an invite. But I mean, I get the idea of what a task board is. It's pretty self-explanatory, but I don't know what the f***ing... I don't know, is it an app or some s***?
0184|
0190|When I get to Perth, if you're interested, I can send you photos and like the exact DIMMs and that and then can go from there. Yeah, I don't know how I'd get over but there'd be a way. There's always a way.
0147|Yeah, forecast looking for the week. Spirits are high, morale are high. Frothing. Check, check it. In with two.
0153|Yeah, post surf alignment, surf with my good friend Mitchell. We ended up searching for waves for about an hour, even though the spot just up there.

0369|It is that time of the month for her though, but you know what they say? It's non-English breakfast unless it's black pudding. Which you won't really get unless you know what black pudding is. Yeah, Charlie Juliette out.
0355|I mean. Fires roaring, feet freezing, cold air today, cold air. Been hearing on the grapevines that your fits may be tubing today. So you're gonna bash bash bash bash bash to about two o'clock.
0341|how do you think we're getting back to Byron from Brisbane if you've kind of thought about that because I'm kind of floating the idea and quite liking the idea in my head of just fucking all the travel off in one go
0396|in FB2 the CF CWR and in the FB3 we are using the TA 2.5 inch T fin.
0382|So you know my email just hit me up with an alignment. Probably send me a WhatsApp as well because I don't really check my personal emails too much. I'm currently on route heading three clicks south-east to...
0157|I always do feel a bit of pressure when I surf with these boys again because you know I always go away for so long and I always feel like I'm you know meant to come back better than when I left which you know is counterintuitive to my surfing ability. Yeah now currently 12.25.

0156|I was still just feeling a bit stiff, you know, hadn't surfed in two days. Kind of had the water in. I'm in new waters, new territories. Well, not new, but, you know, revised. I would need to be refreshed in these territories. Managed to put a couple of fans up there, but you know, nothing special.

0397|Charlie Juliet reports are over and we'll realign post activity. Actually looks fucking stunt. Well no, why am I? Rocky Leves actually looks fucking well fun. But way too many people.
0340|I'd pay for you to take your big board bag with big taco in there and then you can obviously put your board in there and I would bung you the cash for it. I'd also be keen on knowing.
0354|last year which doesn't seem like a lot. So yeah that's that. Tuesdays are the new Mondays baby. Quarter past eight and I've already slapped out fucking near on two hours of work.
0368|I'd be absolutely frothing my fucking chops off. But yeah. Bit of a Debbie Downer today, which is strange. So I might have to go for a cuddle tonight. Maybe lift the mood.
0418|Oh shit, I just got a meeting invite. Looks like I'm gonna have to join. Oh, they just started the meeting. Fuck off, I'm sending a voice now. Went to a yoga session this morning, not that good. Way too fucking spiritual hippie dippy bullshit. Fucking.
0342|and just flying out of Brisbane same day kind of thing. But I've obviously got stuff at yours that I could need to get, but depending on how we're getting down, if one of your housemates is picking us up from Robina or something, then maybe they could just put my.
0356|and then go home for some tubes, I think is the plan. Morale is high, morale is high. I'm choosing to ignore the whole texting because that could be quite a scary little thing, but fuck that. They are not taking my-
0381|and looking forward to the results of your alignment meeting. I'll be on standby if you need a second voice box to waffle some absolute garbage.
0395|we'll be using the Bravo Windmill 003 craft equipped in FB1 with the CF CWL
0168|Yeah, can confirm I wish you told me about the 1.5 thing at the start of that message because that was a fucking two minutes I'm never getting back. I'm 100% doing that from fucking henceforth. Jersey should be on the list. I mean I applied for
0140|in your little fucking hole in the ground because you've been buried because no one wants a bit of soggy firewood.
0154|road from where we first checked was cooking because there was a few too many people and we didn't like that and it was also this pretty heavy crowd at North Narrabin and we don't like heavy crowds so went and surfed another wave which

0008|trying to stuff if I want to drive down the coast or not I've got an hour 2015 to the meeting probably got time
0034|making the same mistake so I think the pro would is definitely quicker so I might invest in it you know fuck thank you for putting me onto that Jesus Christ
0020|absolutely zero reference points. It's so hard to line yourself up. And then they're kind of fat, so you have to paddle real hard, and then you can't see fucking anything.
0236|What a day for it. Fudging what a day. Fudge yeah. Fudge and awesome. Out before first light. Cruising, sun's coming up. Get to the first light.
0222|Send an email, no, reply to a Teams message from my phone and then send an email to both, oh I replied to them sponsoring me like
0223|a thank you message and then I sent an email about my chat with Steve and if they want me to ask anything more and that is fucking it and I haven't even been surfing I went and checked the waves and then came home I've just done
0237|Mark drop down the base bang fish on we're getting snapper we're getting sharks we're getting barracudas we're getting sharks we're getting weird little red things that they're using for live bait we're getting
0021|And then by the time you cleared your eyes and you're going down the line, it kind of stand up and get a bang or two in. But fuck me, she's blowing her tits off. And then I got out so far down the beach.
0035|So apparently I've done, um, well, I don't know if I just cut, apparently I've done eight hours and 15 minutes of work today. Um, we'll run with that number five and a half hours of that. Oh no, six hours of that.
0009|I'm on the fucking road and she's blown her fucking tits off holy shit I'm flying down the fucking South Coast Road whatever whatever it's called you know when you you kind of get the view

0155|was considerably worse. Pretty stiff today. I did my own personal stretch this morning. Really focusing on loosening up the hammies and lengthening those hamstrings, which kind of follows through into the lower back. But yeah.
0141|I had my earbuds on the charge for my whole day. I put them in like when I got on the plane. I had to fly from Newtown to Alton. I'm fucking walking.
0169|the visa and I'm pretty sure I haven't actually checked if I got it but I'm pretty sure I got it so I'd be surprised I should check if I've got it I now remember Mexico being fucking visa on arrival and yeah when you do the thing and you put it up there and then it kind of just does that weird kind of like in but
0394|Charlie Juliet, lead member of the TC battalion, will be advancing on entering the water in roughly t-minus five minutes.
0380|listening to my body and my body was telling me, Jay, give her five. You know, you don't need to do this this morning. So that is what I didn't do. Yeah, interesting about the transit visa. I suspected as much.
0357|you fucking three board quiver away from me I'll tell you that for free and what else is going on not much just straight straight cruising being productive this morning did some yoga this morning did some yoga last night you know

0419|Like, way too much. Like a young instructor, young people in the room, fucking Luli Lemming, good law. Not worths. It was just fucking a bit much. It was a bit too like...
