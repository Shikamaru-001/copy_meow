103|Mahoutsof, a limeman, short and sweet, da surf wut wut!
117|So this morning I've self-assigned my, what? I've self-assigned myself, I've assigned myself the very, very crucially important task to generate a analysis flowchart of the work I've been doing. And to do that, how am I doing that? Well, what I've done is I've given Gemini CLI a prompt to go into my function and just search everything and generate the prompts for me to copy and paste into another AI tool. And I'm setting up a UX pilot account, which is an AI wireframing thingy. And then I'm going to copy and paste the Gemini output prompts to then put into this UX pilot. Um, to fucking do it all for me. So I will keep you updated on how it goes. Oh, oh, UX pilot, you want money from me? Fuck off. I'm going to use a different one. Okay. Okay. I'll keep you updated. Whimsical. Join for free. That sounds good.
116|Yeah, and what I also think is really cool, and what I'm really enjoying is that like every couple of weeks, something happens with Clixed. And even though like, if you looked at it from when we very first started to now, in terms of actual progress, arguably, one could potentially say there hasn't been a great deal in the last six months, potentially, or wherever it's been. However, to me, there's been a fucking huge progress. And we keep coming across new tools, new things to learn about, and new areas to improve our development games, which is the most important part. And she probably actually build the website. And actually fucking just do it. But yeah, fucking shit happens. Shit takes time. And yeah, that's OK, because this is a safe space and a productive environment where there's no pressure from the outside world.
102|I'm on the fucking road and she's blowing her fucking tits off, holy shit! I'm flying down the fucking South Coast road, whatever it's called. You know when you kind of get the view of Oakes Beach from the road off your gaff? Jesus Christ! It's windy. Holy smokes. But I'm frothing. I'm absolutely frothing. Sydney just sent me a message saying Fitz was smaller than Super Windy. So fucking keen! Woohoo! Fuck's sake, man. I'm meant to have afternoons and that, you know what I mean?
17|Yeah, I remember him saying it was a high tide, it's pretty buggery. Which can't confirm because I surfed the groin in the morning and was looking over and it was burger. Yeah, fuck, fun. Another fun wave ticked off the fucking list. Now to tick off some nyesh. I'm doing yoga this morning as well. Fucking inspired by the Willis family. I'm going to shine yoga. Yoga for stiff people. Okura Hall, 9am.
15|Ended up from drop your rents off and then when the surfed To the right of the groin at low tide, I don't know what white ease Or something. I don't know. I don't know what's good Fuck me, I don't know why your dad was shitting on it so much. It's actually well fun it was like overhead and then you could do like I'd like this inside kind of Bully section and you could fucking wrap it and Last fucking so many ways. I've done like four or five times in it was sick Fucking hell it was cold. Those easties or suvely's blown strong and then Fuck what's her face Sydney was like? I joined a come mine for a drink. So they okay and then went for a drink there. He's hanging out and then Bounce to go go home and have some dinner and then when I'm driving home, she fucking measured me the screenshot And I was like what?
101|Sound effects were pretty enjoyable there. Um, fucking Blern is cunt off, eh? Part of my French. Is that pretty southerly as well? Trying to stuff if I want to drive down the coast. Or not. I've got an hour, two hours and fifteen till the meeting. Probably got time.
115|What were check out that down going down It is morning time I'm not feeling well rested and you can guess why Cold Still sat in the car after arriving at the house because car has heater House no heater house need make fire fire take time to warm house house called I called
129|That is your JS now brother, your JS. So don't refer to it as mine ever again. I've passed on the baton. Shame to hear about the surf. Quite disappointed actually in that. But you know we do love a big amount of crab hunting. So that's fun. Update on the old Naki coastline. I'm down in the graveyard now and it's still blowing its absolute fudging tweed off. Absolute Harry Swede blowing off. Absolute blowing its bloody teats off. Absolute was a size double D cup. Now it's negative double triple A's. Absolutely fucking blowing. It's blowing off the mountain harder than a Japanese samurai slices a bamboo stick in half. It's blowing so hard that if one were to step outside of one's vehicle, one would potentially end up in Australia. It is blowing so hard that I believe the rocks underneath the reef are even moving. Fuck me it's so windy. Holy shit. Few guys out, few tangos out of graveyards, maybe five, six people. Got another fucking he's got a huge nose. Oh my God. That poke your eye out. Wow. That's unfortunate for him. Yeah. Five tangos out of graveyards. Pretty small. Blowing its teats off. I doubt there'd be anyone at Rocky Road so I might go check that.
28|I don't know what you're talking about. I mean in fairness, Rocky Leves like did look better but there's like ten guys in it and graveyard was empty and like fair some of them were burgers but on like quite a lot of them it's like proper inside bowl and you could just fuck off there'd be at least like one bang section and like a few cutties but fuck so fun and that is extremely funny regarding your your parents already fucking or your mom already saying yeah um all good that made me laugh and enjoy yourself brother fucking spank the cun out of it
14|Your parents know like me they know pick up and then just went to the garage brings out a battery pack jumper thingy did absolutely fuck all might be a walking home in this right
38|What a day for it. Fudging what a day. Fudge yeah. Fudging awesome. Out before first light. We're just cruising. Sun's coming up. Get to the first mark. Drop down the baits. Bang! Fish on! We're getting snapper. We're getting sharks. We're getting barracudas. We're getting sharks. We're getting weird little red things that they're using for live bait. We're getting sharks. We're getting sharks. We're getting snapper. We're getting sharks. I got a big fat fudge off shark. Fudging huge. And I was like BWAAAAAAA! I fudged and need a photo of that. And they're like well yeah mate. That's not what we usually take photos of. It's not the target space chase. I was like nah! That thing's huge. Let me snap that one up. Well good. Well good innit bruv. It was sick. And now I'm absolutely fried. Didn't get much sleep last night. We were getting the Posh Posh stamp. Woo woo! And now Kaman's chewing his ear off on teams. Messing me. And he's like can we have a call? And I'm like meh. No. Just do what you think is best and then I'll tell you if it's right. I'm fudging tired. And then I've got five meetings till... Oh fudge. Six till eight. Fudging hard to say fudge. I don't know if I like this.
10|just um just surfed back beach with Sydney fucking like waist high jubbly drop but might have to try get a little fucking stampy wampy on the passporty warty
105|Beetroot in salad. Do you need to cook it or do you just cut the bitch up?
138|Benjamin, Benjamin January, this is Jay. Just surfed back beach, super small, another tick for the butternose. But I've pretty much spent the entire surf thinking of crystal bit, crystal box, crystal fucking wire, whatever, and the possibilities of it. And I was chatting to Steve at yoga this morning, and then he got me thinking about offshore installation vessels, and really any offshore rig. And the amount of documentation involved in those kind of procedure operations is like insane. And using I don't know what the thing would look like, or how it would operate. But something like say they're offshore, and they can't remember what the operational conditions. So how big the sea can be for like an RV, they could just open up crystal bit type in, you know, what what RVs are on board, others RV 004 006 and 009. What is the operational limit like conditions of 004. And then it just comes up and fucking, you know, provides you the documentation need for that. And like for literally anything like that on board, you could do all the equipment on the vessels and pretty much any construction site has to be dated and checked every year. So you could have like, you know, you plug you upload all of your equipment specifications, and like the day of last review, you know, as but which would be on this like the check sheet, whatever it is, put them all into the model. And then like every month, you can get it to send you a fucking report of, okay, what's expiring, what needs to be renewed, what's going to the end of his life kind of thing. And that would be useful in literally any construction site, any fucking warehouse kind of thing with equipment that adheres to regulations. Fuck possibilities to end this. This could be huge. Huge.
110|fuck that noise that sounds like such a headache in other news holy fucking shit I love CLI like wow I'm actually fucking in disbelief how quickly I've just managed to fucking do that work I can't fucking believe that it's insane and it's so crazy and like the the ability for it to run the run the script and then you know it comes up with an error and then it just fucking debugs it and then runs again new error fucking debug run again I can't believe it this changed my life for sure that's insane oh I fucking love computers man holy shit Wow and yeah I did just bang out an extra fucking probably what did I put in the sheet ah I put an extra hour that I didn't do which is probably a fucking skimping a bit probably should put an extra two hours down fuck me wow so stoked on that and I was using flash for the last hour or so and it seemed to be doing all right but it kept on making the same mistake so I think the pro would is definitely quicker so I might invest in it you know fuck thank you for putting me onto that Jesus Christ
11|Also, I don't know what a task board is or how to send an invite. But I mean, I get the idea of what a task board is. It's pretty self-explanatory, but I don't know what the f***ing... I don't know, is it an app or some s***?
{f}|I Funline is back up and operational temporarily. It's been absolute cluster fuck quick alignment I'm stoked to hear you absolutely bang the fucking for jazz a lot of it today very stoked for you Absolutely frothing. Oh shit. I've just got a meeting about it. Looks like I'm gonna have to join Oh, they just started the meeting fuck off. I'm sending a voice now That I went to a yoga session this morning. Not that good way to fucking spiritual hippie dippy bullshit Fucking like way too much like a young instructor young people in the room fucking Louie Lemmon good law Not worse. It was just fucking bit much. It was a bit too like They just check out your heart fuck off. I'm here to get limbo. Yeah, not be a good person Do you know I mean sounds a bit of disappointment? Other than that done about five hours. I work today, you know, it's good Friday Had a beer already. We're about I got half an hour meeting. I'm gonna get to the pub and get Absolutely It's a pretty frothing on that I'm picking up some some future friends tomorrow for the taco grinder and right
13|I do, I do, I do, I do. But man's got business to doing that, you know what I'm saying? Just got out of the surf at the groin. Fucking pretty peaky. Those are waves. But fuck, they're a bit like just A-framing and not much like actual frame beyond the A. But yeah, it was fun. Fucking cold though. But yeah, in like an hour and a half maybe if you're still about, I'll be keen for an alignment call.
106|Um raw raw beetroot and nagoody. I don't like you. I don't know if you're meant to eat it like that but I cut some up and I had a fucking nibskey. Little rabbit. If I was a rabbit I would have spat it out and shown it but I'm human so put it in the bin. Or the compost actually for some worms to enjoy. Maybe worms like the beetroot. Venison. Charlie Juliet approved though. Just had a banging salad. I'm talking venison. Fucking bleeding. Still dearing or whatever they are. Soft boiled egg. Rocket. Spinach. Raw obviously. Avocado. Mature cheddar. Finely sliced. Some walnuts. And then some potatoes. Part boiled and then fried off in some coconut oil with onions and then some garlic butter in there. Obviously basted the shit out of the venison. Steak. Steak. Steak. Steak and garlic butter as well. So yeah man was cooking in the kitchen and that man man thought the whole thing was gonna blow. That mean. Um yeah. Okay Juliet. Charlie out.
112|So apparently I've done, um, well, I don't know if I just cut, apparently I've done eight hours and 15 minutes of work today. Um, we'll run with that number five and a half hours of that. Oh no. Six hours of that was working on this, um, the script, which is the fucking like a side quest essentially, which is so jokes because I've got so much fucking other work to do. Uh, fucking we have a laugh. Oh well.
113|I can't wait to fucking click on it as well. Um, yeah, I've been, I'm looking forward to that. I've just not been managing my time very well. And it's that weird thing of like, you know, when you don't have any set amount of time to do work work. So then I just don't, I don't know, like I'll end up working. Like now I've worked until 10 to seven and now I need to go get dinner and shit. So I won't do any click shit and I could have done clicks earlier, but I was kind of just like fucking about with work instead of just bashing it out and like setting myself, you know, time to do it. Like I give myself time to go surfing, but she'll come.
107|Fuck it was it was kind of doing it just getting blown off harder than a slit eye and a tight brothel but fuck I had some shape few sick ones absolutely zero reference points it's so hard to line yourself up and then they're kind of fat so you have to paddle real hard and then you can see fucking anything and then by the time you cleared your eyes and you're going down the line it kind of stand up and get a bang or two in but fuck me she's blown her tits off and then I got out so far down the beach and had to walk so far fucking as well as a pretty a lot of paddling but yeah fuck she's all right
61|Yeah, I don't know. It was a fucking weird one though because when I got my last paycheck I was like fuck yeah, and looked at my savings. I fuck yeah, I got fucking cash. I'm sorted like my scone after in that and Then I don't know just started I think was more about the hours I'd done that week, even though I don't know my company any hours, but it's just that Dark side to the casual worker That really eats me up in terms of the guilt of not doing work Even though I don't have to do any work because I'm not contractually employed to do a set number of hours a week Yeah, I don't know I'm sweet so this morning actually just booked another flight, you know Because money comes money goes brother So that was kind of fun and Then did some yoga this morning yoga of Adrian online mobility class. I'm not really liking this chick I'm not gonna lie. I find she moves a bit too quick for me You know, I'm trying to set up in whatever she's telling me to do and next minute she's moving on to the next one so Yeah, I don't know how I feel about that. I did mobility one. I don't really feel that much. I don't know I'm not like full full mobile. I thought I'd be more mobile after it but really cool about your pie This is really cool and I really I'm enjoying hearing about the piracy you're doing. It's quite inspiring. Can I hack into your pie? Not hack. I don't know how to hack anything apart from big fat top turn push Go Maricopa in a few hours. Woo. No hunting though Old mate hunter boys not not around this weekend, which is a shame So just gonna be hanging out with Sydney and then the granddad me and the family already brother two weeks in it's how we do it Ain't no time like the present no time to lose
75|Yeah, sorry. I've done this a lot recently. I forget why I'm voice messaging. And it was to say that if I do go check the waves, I'm probably going to miss the alignment meeting. But I'll keep you posted on that.
49|Yeah, Maricopa. It might be. Could be on. Seems like a pretty sick spot. And falling in love or exploiting. Very black and white there Benjamin. Can two people not just enjoy each other's company and have a good time and hang out and hang out the back of it simultaneously? So I would say neither. Although probably more. I know I wouldn't say exploiting. I was going to say more leaning towards exploiting. But I'm not exploiting at all. I feel like I'm being very, very considerate to everything. And fuck yeah, I'll go Maricopa. It seems sick ass spot. Hunting, fishing, camping.
148|Good morning BJ, BJ, BJ, BJ, BJ, this is JC, JC, Juliet Charlie, Juliet Charlie, Juliet Charlie, BJ, checking in, checking in, check, check, check, check, check. The time is 6.23. I arrived to the humble abode at around half 11pm last night, Australian, West, Australian Eastern Standard Time. At 4am I woke up to go drop my mate to the airport. Um, I think I actually went to bed at midnight, so a good 4 hours sleep. Um, beautiful sunrise here this morning, light variable offshores, good bit of swell. My friend reckons it's going to be a head high overhead. Um, so we're going to go for a nice surf together at 9, 9.30 in the morning. Um, brother's birthday tomorrow. He's getting the absolute fucking presence from the Lord himself. Lord Morpheus is going to morph sand the fucking, the endless dreamer wherever the fuck he calls himself. The Bastion out, Bastion out on the plane. Um, yeah, forecast looking for the week. Spirits are high, morale are high. Um, frothing. Check, check it. In with two.
160|Good morning, Vietnam! Um, birthday was chill. He had a good day. He had two chefs. He had a full English breakfast. We made steak tacos. We played some pool, had a few swirls. Um, pretty chill, pretty mellow. Tonight's gonna get absolutely head kicked through the fucking door! Absolute slung tom bomb off the top rope! Still available! No! Don't do it! Don't do it! Oh my God! Don't do it! Get off me! Fuck! Um, uh, yeah, I'll land it. I'll check and I'll send you a text.
48|Um, yeah, man, that's no worries. Um, if you want to be that insecure about the relationship with your father, that's fine. Yeah, that's your problem. That's not my problem. Um, Scott and I had a lovely conversation. Thank you very much. He was so excited to speak to me. It's almost like he didn't have his own son. I think he was way more excited to speak to me than it was you. Um, uh, job. Yeah, fuck the job. Fucking take him for the work that right now. Milk the fuck out of it and then bounce and see what happens in the future. Although I can't really comment because I'm in a very comfortable position. So it's not really relatable. So I do apologize for that, but I'm sure you'll be sweet. Fucking you're smart. Kiki, you can get a job. You can get a job at my work and we can get a little more together and you can build our software. You actually probably fucking kid to be fair.
74|Hey mate, f***ing mid afternoon alignment. Yeah, probably a bit too frothed this morning. Yeah, tricky. Let's call it tricky. Tide was low, waves were misaligned. Rocks, a lot of rocks at Stent, Stent Wright. More rocks than I've ever encountered before. Very strangely breaking. Couldn't really sit on the inner thing because of the thing with that kind of system above pushing the peaks kind of in towards that kind of area. Subsequently had to kind of fang a little bit wider, meaning the wave shape was kind of doing a weird thing on that kind of plane. However, I did wrap a few around pretty solidly on the rail. Didn't start doing any work till the one o'clock meeting. Was in meetings from one till let's call it 2.30. Did some photo editing during those meetings. It's now three o'clock for the last 25 minutes. I've just sat on the couch, moped, replenished my lungs. And now I think I might have to go check the surf again. Yeah, today's today ain't a fucking business day. Put it that way, brother. Yo.
76|Yep, yep, check, check, check in. This is Charlie Juliet, Charlie Juliet, region four, Bravo W, fucking windmill. At Graveyards now. Fuck, she's junky. Oh, fucking yep, junky. I'm really made out of wave yet. But fuck with frothing. We are so out there, solo sesh. There's no one in the entire pay or a road, wherever it's fucking good. We are frothing. We are out there. I'll CC back in afterwards. Charlie Juliet out.
62|Getting a little bit A little bit pissed off about like I keep working keep getting meetings and evenings And then I just keep um Not being not prioritizing Um doing any clicks thing and it's really annoying because I want to post some more instagrams, but I need to do Like I need to go through my um my scans on on my laptop to actually get some more From sa to post before I start posting about other stuff And I was about to say I don't know I don't have any time but it's fucking that's just not true benjamin I'm just not prioritizing it and I need to hold myself accountable for that So maybe when i'm back from next week, i'm gonna make a priority, you know sift through And get all the pictures that are on my my computer ready for little postie voiceties and and you know use canvas make a web wireframe Kind of shit and actually I was using canva To um make a kind of wireframe flow chart for this analysis method or analysis we have to do because i'm translating from octa to python Because yo I was getting confused about it And I was getting so lost so I thought you know what i'm gonna map this out I'm gonna make it nice and visual i'm a visual learner um And yeah, I don't know canva it really ain't tickling my pickle not gonna lie to you. It's a bit It's a bit There's too much like Flows and whistles and too much ai shit and too much Like graphics and fun stuff and I was like, I don't want fun. I want practical So we'll see how we go with that
88|Yep, check check check check claim Juliet and Sten road wrecking 9 a.m. Fucking variable suvelies real strong suvelies variable suvelies To me as well ish a bit junkie Hopefully it's gonna be fucking mack a-woofing and there's gonna be no one out. So you're gonna hit that 9 a.m. After some work and Then I've got some venison steaks for myself. How about that? Call me a fucking hunter cuz I'm about to fuck some bitches Clay and Juliet out will probably pre-align a line after post-align morning alignment for the mid-morning alignment But pretty mid-morning because it'll be pretty surf Alignment
63|Also still no snus, still no chewing gum, just raw dogging the rollies baby, feeling good about it. Although I'm fucking raw dogging rollies man, yoish. But yeah, making um, making progressions there you could argue.
77|Post surf alignment. Wow. Fuck. That was something, I'll tell you that for free. Big junkie. There was literally waves on the wave and half the time I didn't even know what wave I was surfing. Managed a couple of wraps. Bang on the last one. I was fucking, praise the Lord, I'm getting out kind of thing. It was getting dark as well. No idea where to sit. Sets coming left front center. Real misaligned. But yeah, for often had a good time. I had a real good time. People over here don't understand full meme. I swear because I'm getting blinded by the lights on this whole drive back, which has been pretty hectic. I'm voicing for something else and I can't remember what it was. Oh, well firstly, Jersey cows.
73|Hey mate, pre-alignment, alignment, pre-alignment, claying in, claying in, check, check, check, check, heading down the coast, down the coast, had a super fucking unproductive morning, fuck yeah, productivity through the floor, it's Monday, you know how we roll, meant to wake up at five, get some stretching in, in the office by six, six to nine, three hours, bang done, reality check, fucking probably actually only done about 15 minutes of work, down the coast, west at least forecasted, onshore, onshore, back to my roots, this is where jersey men shine, we love onshore, onshore is what we live for, hopefully it's going to be about a head high overhead, couple onshore, just some absolute fuck off sections, so we're real alone, once I'm out of the waves, I've absolutely ripped the bag out of it, we're feeling pumped, we're feeling jammed, we're feeling motivated, check, check, one, two, one, two in the business,
98|Yeah, fucking Nickajew with the crochet absolutely smashed it out the park on that one. What a good little dude. Um That's fucking sick though you made it made that you made that you get the credit Um, I like that a lot and i'm wondering if that can just do the whole With enough prompts just create the whole template for the website so I don't have to draw up and canva Because cam is a prick
66|Yep, Clayton in. Wow. Frothing, stoked, buzzing. Vibed out for you there, bro. Wow, best fucking bang you've done. That's a claim and a half. Maricopa. Fucking unreal place. Sick time. I went and surfed on the way up yesterday. Little waist high, where do you wave? Well from on the twin blade. Fucking did the railing though. Like shinned it when I was trying to bang it. But I did bang the fuck out of it and a few before it. And then went around to that friend's place yesterday. Fucking well funny. And then today, I'm in a copa like seven. Sydney was like, do you want to go for a walk up the hill? I was like, okay. Absolutely stomped up this mountain motherfucker. Huge. And then went and checked the waves but no dice. And then went fishing. And got a 10 snapper. A couple other things. Sick. Yeah. And then waves are pumping next week. So, well Tuesday at least. So yeah, fucking buzzing.
8|Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin. Um, quick one while I'm in my head. Before you book any Barley flights, can we have an alignment meeting regarding surfboards? Because I have a little sniff from based off a meeting with my director yesterday that I very well may be moving to Perth in February. At some point, I'd like my tackle grinder on that side of Australia, and this could be a good opportunity to get it close. And that would work around something like me taking off. I take a board bag with my boards, and then I would pay for your for you to take your big board bag with big tackle in there. And then you can also put your board in there. And I would bung you the cash for it. And I'd also be keen on knowing how do you think we're getting back to Byron from Brisbane? If you've kind of thought about that, because I'm kind of floating the idea and quite liking the idea in my head of just fucking all the travel off in one go and just flying out of Brisbane same day kind of thing. Um, but I've obviously got stuff at yours that I could need to get. But depending on how we're getting down, if one of your housemates is picking us up from Robina or something, then maybe they could just put my shit in the car. And then at Robina, we fucking trade items. And then I just get the train back up to Brizzy because there's a half full flight Brisbane to Bali for $250 on Jetstar. And I can use my Jetstar Club fucking voucher to get 20% off baggage.
159|Yeah, can confirm I wish you told me about the 1.5 thing at the start of that message because that was a fucking two minutes I'm never getting back. I'm 100% doing that from fucking henceforth. Jersey should be on the list. I mean I applied for the visa and I'm pretty sure I haven't actually checked if I got it but I'm pretty sure I got it so I'd be surprised. I should check if I got it. I now remember Mexico being fucking visa on arrival and yeah when you do the thing and put it up there and then it kind of just does that weird kind of like invert on the kind of end of it and it just happens that sometimes it does that and it's quite difficult because you know when you're trying to do that thing and then especially when the kind of tide is doing that and then you got the back ocean kind of putting it up there it's kind of pretty difficult I can imagine to continue doing that now. So yeah brother just returned from the surf he said it was fucking waste time windy as fuck so I'm gonna go and check it. Yeah you're right it was truffing yesterday and we fucked it. And I went and sat the shit wave because there was fucking people where it was good. And New Zealand's corrupted means they're not surfing with people.
164|I Funline is back up and operational temporarily. It's been absolute cluster fuck quick alignment I'm stoked to hear you absolutely bang the fucking for jazz a lot of it today very stoked for you Absolutely frothing. Oh shit. I've just got a meeting about it. Looks like I'm gonna have to join Oh, they just started the meeting fuck off. I'm sending a voice now That I went to a yoga session this morning. Not that good way to fucking spiritual hippie dippy bullshit Fucking like way too much like a young instructor young people in the room fucking Louie Lemmon good law Not worse. It was just fucking bit much. It was a bit too like They just check out your heart fuck off. I'm here to get limbo. Yeah, not be a good person Do you know I mean sounds a bit of disappointment? Other than that done about five hours. I work today, you know, it's good Friday Had a beer already. We're about I got half an hour meeting. I'm gonna get to the pub and get Absolutely It's a pretty frothing on that I'm picking up some some future friends tomorrow for the taco grinder and right
59|Yeah, sick. Well that's good then. I'm sure she will serve and support you and beckon to your every demand and bow at your feet. I just marched, no not marched, stomped up to Ghost Peak. Made that thing my bitch. Bit of a weird afternoon actually. For some, like I got fucking super anxious about nothing. It was real weird. For like, until I went on the hike. It was really strange. I think I was weirdly, I was stressing about cash even though I've got more than enough already. So I've only done like, fuck like 24 hours this week and tomorrow I'm taking a mental health day because we're going to Maricopa. And then I started like, getting weird anxiety over something that I know I shouldn't worry about. And it was real strange. And then I went and fucking stomped the shit out of Ghost Peak. And then I'm going to go do some work now. But yeah, strange afternoon. Probably because I haven't surfed in like two days as well. I reckon that had something to do with it.
54|yeah I mean if you think the dead animal watching weird fucking you should seen the cat she's got like a little kitten and that fucker was just you know again all the tips and tricks yeah she's also got fucking like possum pillows like a couple possum fur pillows and maybe possum fur blanket which I was like that's I know she kind of choked it in me is that's possum fur I was like whoa I don't know this feels weird now but primal I guess kind of primal you got to try new things you got to put yourself out there
83|Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, buddy. Yeah, buddy, light weight, baby, light weight, baby. Fucking Juliette Charlie in. Checking in, check, check, check, check, one, two, one, two. Sun is shining. The birds are chirping. The sheep just plowed through the fence. The fucking black one leading the pack. No surprise there. Rain, rain, rain. Rain, rain, rain. Last night, pretty hectic rain, actually. Real hectic. Potentially fitting, given tax officers reckon I fucking won't slap them 3k. Do they not know who I am? This is not how this arrangement works, buddy. Mr. ATO, you pay me. I ain't giving you a dime. So I'm going to investigate that with a registered tax official, see how illegal I can do this and not pay them a cent. Although, reviewing my pay slips, I do think they may potentially have some grounds to stand on, given I only paid 14k in tax last year, which doesn't seem like a lot. So, yeah, that's that. Tuesdays are the new Mondays, baby. Quarter past 8, and I've already slapped out fucking near on two hours of work. Do you know what I mean? Fires roaring, feet freezing, cold air today, cold air. Been hearing on the grapevines that your fits may be tubing today. So you're going to bash, bash, bash, bash, bash till about 2 o'clock and then go home for some tubes, I think is the plan. Morale is high. Morale is high. I'm choosing to ignore the whole tax thing, because that could be quite a scary little thing. But fuck that. They are not taking my new fucking three board quiver away from me. I'll tell you that for free. What else is going on? Not much. Just straight cruising, being productive this morning, did some yoga this morning, did some yoga last night. You know how it is. We just out here vibing and stoked on the old, you know, what you're doing with your fucking key clacking. That's real cool. I think you should just invest in it and stop crying over $5 and being a little tight ass bitch. Yeah. Juliet Charlie out. PS, when you say out, it means you're fucking done. So don't send me another one after you say out. Out. JC out.
154|But yeah, a bit more of an alignment I guess. So obviously you know man's always learning on his feet and that. So I got here and mate went away, we're standing in the gas. So I've got his car and his room. Very Dougs. It's our brother's birthday today, so the boys are going to be coming around, should be about six, seven of us. Drinking some beers, low carb beers only, 87 calories per bottle, health as well. A few swadi wadi, a few frames and that, this and that. Tomorrow morning probably try to go for a little grovel. I've spent the last two days, spent an hour and 15 minutes driving up and down the same 10km on my car so we can pull away because we just don't go anywhere. Wherever the fuck we turn up because, ah piss me off. Tomorrow morning I'm turning up, I'm not even looking at it, I'm just putting my website on and going, I can't be arsed. Paddling around, I've been driving around for that long. And then tomorrow night, it's Friday night, big one in the sea, it's, it's, it's. All the boys are going to come around, it's drinking beers, drinking beers, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're having a good time, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big. Then we're going to go see, we're going to go bowling, fucking tamping bowling, smash a few fucking frames out, a couple swazi ones, couple strikes, couple spares, you know this and that. Then we're hitting the big fucking karaoke bar, laying down some of the hardest tracks man man's ever seen, you know. And then we're going to hit the sea, hit the tunes, see what's whiffing around, see what's sniffing, see what's whiffing. And then, and then yeah, Saturday probably feel pretty sorry for ourselves and I'm not going to tell you how I'm feeling Saturday so you don't even get the opportunity to rub in my face the arm all over like I did to you. So yeah, fucking how about that one, you slimy little weasel. Also alignment, seriously, I've done my fucking American visas, I'm pretty sure I got that. And do we still need to look for accommodation in fucking gay place, gay town?
96|actually wanted to do what I actually wanted to do was just update you on the fact I've just submitted my tax checklist to my countin my countin man thing is gonna do is ting and that man man Yeah, and I also just submitted $2,500 and flights to him from Perth. I don't know how fucking right that is also put a high car on there to go down to Margaret River for the weekend and $300 of PPU and a grand and a half on a laptop and $200 on washing and $250 on station room. So yeah, coming up trumps I reckon
41|Well that just sounds like a marvellous day doesn't it? I'm unequivocally stoked for you and that is inspiring that you've warmed up your hip flexes. Who was the crew? And I'm sure you did put it up there. Don't put yourself down like that. Put it up brother. Jealous yourself and tell others what a wave man. Who was the crew? It was Skipper Steve and I think Hayden. I don't know. I think his name was Hayden. So you know they knew what they were doing. And yeah piping is a terrible word Ben. You know kind of misogynistic as if they're an object. They're not. But yeah you know he gets Ben Webster 650. So fair game if you ask me. You'll get a little discount as well.
5|And then there's obviously just still the option of me just bringing it to endo and then whatever Which is yeah fine obviously the subbing here, but it's a bit annoying because I was just getting myself soaked to self to self hold Rip the f*** out of it, but then whatever you know I could just have that, I could just have my twin play I've got so many selfs, once in a case you didn't know, yeah so many So I'm losing my f***ing marbles So yeah that's still an option, I can always just do that I'll keep the post Pun, mine, pun, intentional
57|And about your job, I reckon, I don't know, I reckon you're getting yourself worked up over something that you don't need to get yourself worked up over. You know, your company said to you the other day how fucking indispensable you are. And obviously the market is changing a lot in respect to software developers and stuff. But then I feel like you're different and you set yourself apart because of how much of a genuine personal interest. So I'm just kicking my fucking snapper you have in the field. And the only thing you can really do is one, don't worry about something that isn't even confirmed to be happening and two, be proactive about it. And if you are like genuinely concerned that your job might not be lasting longer, then just start casually looking around for like other solutions. But what you actually ain't going to fucking do is have a shit moody time when you're away because you're worried about the real fucking world. All right.
80|Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Pretty stoked on that. Congratulations, Nickers. Sending all the good luck and energy your way. I'd suggest you don't tell them about your fucking pig fat odor shit. Probably won't go down too well. Have all the best with it. She does sound pretty needy. Yeah, not jealous of you there, bud. Siddha's messaged me saying she was on her time of the month. So that's pretty fucking buzzing. There's no baby Jay coming because, yeah, pretty questionable put our game at times. So, yeah, pretty stoked on that, actually. Real stoked. Not getting fucking trapped here. Enjoy yourself.
142|Now, Sydney's whipping up steak ciabattis. Yeah, fair enough. Put my report in there. Oh, it's local, isn't it? So it doesn't actually matter. Yeah, probably not on the buzzer tonight. But just been acquiring some major, some major accusations from Wollies. Sydney was giving me all evil the first time I told her about it. And now she's fucking grinning ear to ear because I just picked her up some premium, premium good goods. Isn't that right Sydney? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I thought. I'll give you a buzz tomorrow.
95|Charlie Juliet, Charlie Juliet, Bravo Windfly, Bravo Windfly. Windfly fucking right that one. Fucking good on you. Kudos. Thanks for the status update on the weather, wind and waves. All received. Fucking hell man. Rocky rides. Geez. I think I got three sets on the head that closed out the entire bay and I just sat there like fuck. I was definitely not a single cell padded out. A lot of chop in the face and I did two wraps which were the exact turn I wanted to go out and do. So I was pretty stoked on that. Really finding my groove with the quad. Really stoked on that. Why would you be working on a Wednesday anyway? I'm confused about this whole thing. And then what's the status update on Nicker? Fuck what's the second name? Nickerju. Status update on Nickerju please in terms of job application interview.
4|Shalom, alaikum, alaikum, alaikum, wa shalom, alaikum, wa shalom So I've just spoken to a very lovely lady at Qantas Freight and you know I tipped my surfboard in, put it on the scales, she got the old measuring tape out, measured up the board, got a little cootski-wootski, now express $1180, convenient whatever the fuck that means, 659 and coming in hot with economical at a whopping, so I'm trying to fucking fix this car, figure out this car, drive you silly fucking cunt, $277 so yeah there's a few other options freight companies who I might hop onto the old googly-woogly and have a little qwerty-woaty searchy-woaty but at that price I don't think the um I don't think the value is there you know you could buy um I mean I was just gonna pay for shipping anyway but in my head I was gonna rock up and if it was less than two then you know I was just gonna I was gonna do it kind of thing um you know my cap was two and as you've just heard it's about two um but for $277 you'd be able to buy yourself a fucking board do you know what I mean so you
52|Nicole crochet hobby fuck yeah we're getting some my brother stoked for you um does does Sydney hunt put it this way you go into her bedroom and she has the skull of a deer horns and all or antlers I don't know what the fuck they are right above her bed on the headboard up there so based on that if I was a bedding man I would place a lot of money on the fact she does hunt yeah but I don't know I think she goes with someone else like she doesn't just fucking off if she pops into the woods with a gun and comes back with a deer I think it's like some other people do it with her and she doesn't have a gun I think but hopefully some some fishing some some some surfing and a hunting would be sick so yeah fucking power to the people fuck the vegans woo woo
147|I had my earbuds on charge all day. I put them in when I got on the plane. I'm walking from the domestic to the international terminal and the left is spazzing out constantly saying low battery low battery low battery low battery. If that ain't a sign I don't know what is brother. Inshallah. Godspeed. See you on the other side.
91|Clayton Juliet, Clayton Juliet, Bravo Windmill, Bravo Windmill. TC unit has advanced on location code 3401. Here forth comes the atmospheric meteorological bathymetrical surveys. Starting with the atmospheric, please note in that all figures listed herein, despite being quantitative, is based on a court of assessment derived through engineering judgment. Amphospheric, we're sitting around 1,100 bar pressure. Foul cover hovering around the 0.65 region, expecting to drop. We have on average five millimetres of precipitation per hour, with periods of intense rainfall frequented throughout the day. Meteorologically speaking, we have a mean wave direction heading of around 225 degrees, with an average wind heading of 175 degrees, giving a relative angle of 95 degrees. Hence, when we normalise by MWD, we're looking at a... Oh, hello, that was a nice one. Oh, sorry, I'm in my report. We're looking at a wave wind ratio of about 0.45, which isn't very aligned. In terms of wave height, we've got roughly one and a half times the average human being, provided they're not wearing air forces. He's just fucking banged it like three times on my days. There are one, two, three, four, five, six tangos out at RLs. That's RLs, three tangos. We've got one tango out on a right coming into the Māori boat ramp area, which is really strange, and zero tangos at Gs. Graveyard.
85|Afternoon alignment. Feeling pretty strange actually. Not physically. But had a fucking productive morning. You know, I was up stretching by six. Locked into the grind, half six, you know, caffeinated, nickinated, fire on, banging out work, left right center emails, pew pew pew like an AK. Midday, some leftover curry I made last night, real nice. Snapper curry, fresh snapper was good. Yummy, yum yum yum. Then went to Kathmandu, got my brother a jacket. So he's going to join the club. And then I went to Crystal, whatever the fuck it's called, where Sydney works. Had a yarn, bought a new fin for the trailer. The pretty much what I was been looking for. Little bit smaller than the Chipper Wilson trailer. And then went and surfed Fitzroy. Offshore. Few tubes, I got a few tubes, I got two tubes, both backhand. Banged it a few times. The fin's really nice. Really nice balance between little bit looser, but you know, doesn't lose any drive. But a little more release. Feels like a bit more lift as well. But yeah, just not really, not really stoked, not really psyched, which is I don't know what's up. Because like normally on a given day, if I've had a fucking stretch, done some work, gone out, got two tubes and banged it a few times with a new fin, I'd be absolutely frothing my fucking chops off. But yeah. Bit of a Debbie Downer today, which is strange. So I might have to go for a cuddle tonight. Maybe lift the mood. It is that time of the month for her though. But you know what they say? It's non-English breakfast and this is black pudding. Which you won't really get unless you know what black pudding is. Yeah, Charlie Juliet out.
90|Charlie Juliet, Charlie Juliet, Bravo Wimel, Bravo Wimel, all received. You've had a nice mobility stretch this morning. You are caffeinated and you have researched visas. Point number one, yeah, I think I need to start doing that with Adrian. I'm going to pause and really just finding the rhythm because I'll be in a nice stretch and then she'll be fucking flying off to the moon and I'm ready for it. I can confirm I did not mobilize myself this morning. I wasn't feeling it and I didn't want to force it. I'm listening to my body and my body was telling me, Jay, give it five. You don't need to do this this morning. So that is what I didn't do. Yeah, interesting about the transit visa. I suspect it as much and looking forward to the results of your alignment meeting. I'll be on standby if you need a second voice box to waffle some absolute garbage. So, you know, my email just hit me up with an alignment, probably send me a WhatsApp as well because I don't really check my personal emails too much. I'm currently on route heading three clicks south-east to location code 3404, otherwise known as Payora Road and that is Princess Alpha Orifice Rectangle Alpha Road. Post wake up, pre surf alignment complete. Charlie Juliette out.
146|You're cracking me up there buddy. I'm fucking so keen for Sydney, actual northern beaches of Sydney. Fucking frothing to hang out with the boys and I'm pretty content with my time in the Naki coming to an end. I've had a great time and that's all I can ask for. But you're wrong Mr. fucking, I don't know, I can't be arsed to insult you because I'm not that kind of guy and my meditations, my yesterday's yoga for stiff people session, the theme of the session was all about compassion and compassion for oneself. So thou shall be compassionate in oneself and extend my compassion to you, good sir. Because it's clear to me that you're so fucking queer that you're penting up your frustration and in compassion and expressing it on others. So maybe you should look in the mirror, little sad crybaby boy. Yeah? Fucking wanker. Pig. Fucking crusty pork rind. Fucking mouldy capsicum. You're like a soft kumara or whatever they're called. Or like a sprouting onion, useless. Pass your cell by day. You're like a fucking bit of firewood that's been left out in the rain. Soggy and wet and useless. No one wants you anymore. You're just gonna go back in the ground when the worms will have you. You can make worm friends in your little fucking hole in the ground because you've been buried because no one wants a bit of soggy firewood.
1|There's actually the exact same flight but arriving Sunday morning instead of Monday morning. So I don't know, it's up to you if you want to. I'm happy for either day, but if you think it's just easier for me to do the Monday one, so then I just go straight to work opposed to Sunday where I would get the train down to the Goldie and then maybe, ask the small courteous favour on top of the million other favours you've already done me in my life of meeting me in the Gold Coast. You know, we could go for a smoothie bowl or get our nails done, surf, I mean we'd go for a surf. Let me know.
3|Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin I went to Ozpost, they don't post anything longer than a meter I messaged the guy, Mr Ben Webb, he says he uses Qantas Airfraight and it's just like Apple to Apple went online, plugged in the DIMS, 500 bucks which is just like, obviously not it when his has gone full way so the only option to progress this is on the weekend if I got a car I'm just going to rock up to Qantas Airfraight with the board bug right and then see what they say there, because there's no way it's 500 fucking dollars and then if it is, then obviously I have to revert to plan B, C or D my preference being on D
144|Good morning Benjamin. It brings me immense joy, satisfaction, gratitude, appreciation for life that you feel like shit. Okay? I just wanted you to know that. One does have fun in the evenings but nothing in this life is free Ben, including fun.
92|Charlie Juliet, lead member of the TC battalion, will be advancing on entering the water in roughly t-minus five minutes. Charlie Juliet will be using the Bravo Windmill 003 craft, equipped in FB1 with the CF CWL, in FB2 the CF CWR and in the FB3 we are using the TA 2.5 inch T fin. Charlie Juliet reports are over and will realign post activity. It actually looks fucking st- well no, why am I? Rocky Lefs actually looks fucking well fun, but way too many people and there's a few coming into graveyards, like Head High, pretty clean offshore. I don't know what it was about, the fucking wave wind ratios, that was kind of misaligned. But I think I'm gonna go for a little walkie walk, wearing two walkie Wefts, walkie Whites, because I wear my white walkie white and I really want to do a big forehand carp today.
93|Charlie Juliet, Charlie Juliet, Bravo Wimel, Bravo Wimel. Checking in after checking our hours, our hours and I'm going to have a craft change upon the observations. I'll be using the BW004 equipped with FB1, FCS2, MBL, L. FB2 is going to be the FCS2, MBL, R. FB3 is going to be the FCS2, R, QR, L, M. FB4 is going to be the FCS2, QR, R, M. Um, zero tangos out. Oh, fucking scared, pussies. Fucking pain.
87|For Dutch Corralio, I was in a weird ass fucking mood yesterday. Holy shit balls. Especially going into the evening. Further and further into the evening we got, the fucking more out of my head I became. It was fucked. But fuck that bullshit, I ain't got time for that shit. Namjoon. So today I'm fucking woo woo. I'm currently grinding up some new coffee beans. I'm gonna get nickinated. And then fires on. She's roaring. She's, oh actually. She's not roaring right now. She's only peering. I need to replace some logs. And then work. Key back. Fucking stent road. Bang! Bang! Fuck, sorry, intermission. Cut to music, cut to music. Cut to music.
151|Yeah, post surf alignment, surf with my good friend Mitchell. We ended up searching for waves for about an hour, even though the spot just up the road from where we first checked was cooking, because there was a few too many people and we didn't like that. And it was also this pretty heavy crowd at North Narrabin, and we don't like heavy crowds. So we went and surfed another wave, which was considerably worse. Pretty stiff today. I did my own personal stretch this morning, really focusing on loosening up the hammies and lengthening those hamstrings, which kind of follows through into the lower back. But yeah, I'm still just feeling a bit stiff. I hadn't surfed in two days. Kind of had the water in. I'm in new waters, new territories. Well, not new, but you know, revised. I would need to be refreshed in these territories. I managed to put a couple fans up there, but you know, nothing special. And I always do feel a bit of pressure when I surf with these boys again, because you know, I always go away for so long and I always feel like I'm meant to come back better than when I left. Which, you know, is counterintuitive to my surfing ability. Yeah, now currently 12.25. I've already done two in hours 15. I'm about to lock in for a mega fucking woofing session on the keyboard because work keep deciding that I can't wind down just yet, even though I decided I was trying to wind down fucking two weeks ago. So we'll see how that goes. Fucking see little skywags.
2|Yo, I've got, I was just thinking random shit. And then I realized I've got a 6-4, 19 and a quarter, two and nine sixteenths I want to say. Like a roundtail JS, forget me not, two in perf. Which could be a fucking pretty sick step up for you. And I could get that to you. Somehow, maybe. I could, with difficulty. But I could. And then you could have it. And it's FCS2, but I've got some FCS2s that I don't use that you could have as well. So when I get to perf, if you're interested, I can send you photos and like the exact DIMMs and that. And then can go from there. Yeah. I don't know how I'd get over it, but there'd be a way. There's always a way.
50|Fudge yeah, stoked that you had a sick one at Talos. I'm a little bit jealous Because I went to Sten Road this morning and I fucking bitched it. It was that cold It was like waist-high pretty small super clean no one out a couple little waves But it was almost too small because it's like breaking on some little rock but Fadash Guralio, it was like I swear those eyes on the road is frosty So the reward was not worth it, so I drove home But yeah Blame the tools fuck yeah blame the tools I Agree with that 100% Why'd you think I force earth boards? It's not me. It's the fucking boards. So I keep getting a new one to mask the fact I'm shy And cranium I think I was the craniums your Jed your head and I think I was talking about how I just absolutely clinical precision bang the tits off a fucking top turn And it was like I just two pokes on the eyes and just hit straight eyeball all squidge no Cranium no skull so that was that reference Yeah, what a Baba do bar
78|What's that all about? And it's definitely not Guernsey cows. Guernsey cows, they ain't worth the grass they fucking eat. Uses pieces of shit. Reckon they got Guernsey dairy. They're just fucking copycats. Whatever we do, they just do way worse. Guernsey dairy, silly cows over there. Fucking hell. And then, oh yeah, so just driving back, checking my emails, and I've had like four emails about like new projects and like loads of work coming in. And I'm just like woo woo woo. No, not that. No thank you, señor. So I think this, I'm actually gonna have to do some work this week, which is probably a good thing for the account. Because PNL, I think we're in negatives today with the amount of work I've done. So yeah, how's that?
23|Fuck yeah. Yoga this morning was fucking class. Loved it. It was me and like six fucking mums and dads. It was great. Steve and Nick were there. Went for a coffee with them after. Got the full debrief in Taiwan. Fucking hell. It was actually quite cool because he was working. He was doing the projects that I was designing. So that was kind of cool. But then fucking hell, it just didn't stop. And then went and picked up some mulch from Dean. And now I'm at Graveyard. There's fucking like 11 people out of rocky lefts. Which fucking looks cooking to be fair. No one's on the old yards. And it's about fucking overhead. Howling is fucking cunt off. But looks kind of cooking. So I'm actually taking the cod out. Which is pretty, I'm pretty stoked on that. Solo sesh. Fucking. And yeah, fuck yeah. You like the JS. That's what we like to hear. Now you got me stoked to surf this even more so. And happy anniversary. That's fun. That's cute. You're in love. I'm a fucking kind of losing my marbles even though I've only been on my own for one day. I might do some clickety clacking later if I'm not sniffing out some nyash.
122|Um confidential conversation now so fucking little dewbags hanging around put your fucking headphones in um what am I saying yeah so I was fucking hanging out was hanging out of Sydney I was hanging out with Sydney last night and then yarn and then that and then she said that so Ari and Talia their other mate they had dinner together on like Monday or Tuesday night or whatever and then because Ari had been away on the road with work and whatever and then apparently Ari asked Sydney if you Ben had broken up with your girlfriend yet and then I was like yeah why she asked that and then I don't and then Sydney was ah I'm not really sure but apparently he was speaking about shit and when we said Rocky left together or something so I don't know if she's got the wrong end of the stick or what but um yeah I thought I was pretty curious because I thought you were pretty good but I don't know what you're telling her or if what you're telling her has been misconstrued probably about fucking the hobbies
137|JC in, JC in, BJ are you there? Are you alive BJ? JC concerned about BJ's on the gear again because BJ don't normally do this and BJ do this second time in the last two months. Very interesting. JC quite jealous. JC would love to be absolutely off for someone's woo. Absolutely woo woo on some Mandy with BJ. However JC was hanging out the back of it last night with SW. So yeah, fuck yeah, woo woo. Now it's 8am, I'm going home to realign my chakras, I'm going to yoga for stiff people and then hitting down the coast. SW trying to convince me to surf back beach with her. Fuck that! I want to surf some fucking proper waves. So heading down the coast after yoga, going to be mobile, going to be fucking in line with myself, going to be frothing. Nah, I haven't asked to do that about the fins, I haven't looked. I will though. But check, check, one, two, out, out, out, out, out.
123|Not that it matters in any way shape or form anyway. But yeah, I don't know. Interesting.
34|Fucking love surfing. Wow. Pretty slow. Pretty fucking slow. Sets were only like, well, to be fair, the bigger sets were like chest-head-high. And fucking put it up there in a few of them. Fuck yeah. Super psyched. You know, fucking back knee down. Fucking the pinky toe on the back foot is just sky high. That back knee is dropped all the way on the front knee and the gun compressing down and then just transferring all to the back foot. Letting your weight fucking turn the bottom turn. Fucking then just up to the top and bang! You know, just fuck off. Take that one you fucking gunsy little cow. You fucking milk shit. Do you know what I mean? Woo! Yeah. Fucking love that shit.
20|And listening back to those voice messages, I admit I do sound maybe perhaps a little two-legged feathery bird which cockadoodledoos. Fair enough. But fuck you.
121|I think we've made significant progress for sure. I'm complexed, don't get me wrong. But I feel like if we had a GM and he was reviewing, you know, tangible output of what we've done so far, he may be slightly disappointed. But we don't have a GM. As you just said, you the back end with fucking Claude, me and Jem and I fucking slapping the tits out of the front end. You know, you clapping them cheeks. I'm fucking sucking them nipples. We're about to make some business. Business is booming. And that's, you know, very excited to hear that you're going to go surfing because I'm on my way to surf number seven of the week. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
120|Yeah, yeah, you make a pretty valid point there buddy. The goal, I guess, the way to combat that is for me to now spend an equal amount of time as I would have spent me coding it myself, actually understanding what the fucking code is doing. Such that when I get questions I know where shit is and that kind of thing. But I've got a pretty good understanding of it I'd say already. I just need to get a better, broaden my context window in terms of how the functions are being called into one another. Because that's pretty alien to me and that's why the AI really helped out a lot. So once I get my head around that I should be able to answer the questions. And with the wireframe, that's just fun. Just a little fucking side quest on the side quest. They didn't answer that shit. I was just like, fuck it. And because it's all on the CTR, so what I build my time to is on essentially business development. So they didn't fucking check the hours on that shit. It's not like we can go budget because there isn't a budget on it. So the plan of action from now is to make it all look pretty, get me to understand it. And then have a meeting with the software developer guy and Nick who you met to talk him through what I've done. And I'm an open book. I'll tell him I used fucking AI for it. I don't know if I'll say Gemini because I don't want to give them the upper hand. But I'll say I used some kind of AI to help me with the process. And fucking Sandy, she's about to get her cheeks clapped. Fuck that bitch, man.
134|Yeah, fucking roger that Tango, roger that. Don't spend your whole weekend clacking away, get outside, do some of Nicole. Mid-morning alignment, A.M. Had a pretty good sleep last night, feeling pretty drained in every sense of the word. Got up, lit the fire. Struck with Adrian, did a hip mobility one. Pretty good, actually. Pretty good. Did a couple pauses. Had a coffee. Was on the blowout to the rents for fucking half hour, 40 minutes. Good alignment there. First alignment in a fair while. Was telling about my fishing. I said I went up the coast last weekend with a mate and then they were like, oh, where do you stay at that parents place? I was like, oh, yeah. No, no, stayed at her grandparents with the granddad. And they didn't say anything, didn't ask anything, which I was quite surprised about. So that's pretty jokes. And then now I'm heading down the coast with Corbin. We're not with him. He's not in the car. So I won't be sending his voice message if he was, but going to go meet Corbin, Sydney's brother. So slide a little wave in with him, which would be pretty jokes. And feeling good. Need a shit. Life moves pretty keen, pretty frothing on the surf. Not going to lie to you. Tango out.
108|Fucking hell man. Jesus Christ I've just absolutely shat myself. I was just there like clicking away with Gemini and then like fuck I don't know some like weird like reflection in the window kind of like caught my eye and like it was like someone had arrived kind of thing. Like I didn't see anyone or anything but it like it was kind of that I don't know I got that feeling that things about to turn up but obviously no one's meant to turn up and then like two seconds later like the door the main door like clicks kind of like closed or like you know made a sound fucking hell I swiveled around so quick and like full heart drop oh oh that was cooked. Shat myself oh my days. Ah I better take a smoke oh fuck.
35|I should stop saying fucking so much. It was literally like every other word in that. I just really listened to it. That's hectic. Wow.
19|20 seconds? What? 20? How the fuck do you do that? That's insane. I've never actually made it fucking inside. It just f- BLEH Fucking just before entry. That's impressive brother. Nicole's one lucky lady. Woah! And no fucking chicken as well. Rooster. Come on now.
31|Also, fuck the man looking sexy today. Shit, I'm just driving. But yesterday was the first day in like, I can't remember when the last time, it must be months that I didn't have any Nicky gum or snus. And fuck me, I am so fucking addicted to nicotine. It's insane. I didn't realize how fucking bad it was. But like, I ran out of gum and snus and I'm not going to buy any more. But like, I'd have a ciggy and like as soon as I fucking put it out, I'm like, fuck. Like this is when the gum or the snus would usually go in. And like fucking hell, it's cooked. So I'm stopping that and just gonna go back to the hard stuff, back to the rollies, maybe ease out of them. I didn't have a fucking rollie, any nicotine, from like, fuck, it would have been like half full onwards, which is pretty impressive for me. So I'm pretty stoked on that. So maybe by Mexico, I'll only be having like 10 rollies a day. Which is fucking pretty good going if you ask me, baby.
25|Mate, can't fucking lie. Holy shit. Start that surf. Flow state. Wow. First wave, well first wave was a burger. But second wave, fucking cut back right in the source. I was getting lost in the source. I was fucking showering it, bathing myself, lathering that fucking surf, washing my hair. Come out the source, fucking big break of the line, right down to the bottom, see the section and just bang. Fucking knife through the heart. It was like just two fingers gouging straight into fucking eyeballs. No cranium, pure fucking eye. Boosh! And then fucking come down and I'm like fuck me. Holy shit. And then got flogged on the inside and then turn around and there was another wave and I was like holy fuck I feel shallow. It was pretty skits. And then got a fucking, I was putting them up there. You know what I mean? Bang! It was so fun. Also really fucking hard to position yourself. The old titty mountains all covered up in clouds so I couldn't line myself up with it. And then the thing did that thing and the thing was kind of thinging around and the kind of pressure of the air and the fucking humidity kind of made it like that thing and over time it just kind of thinged out. You know what I mean?
124|Yeah alignment with a Silver Fox Willis Complete or Silver Fox Windfly. Gonna go check the K-Patch. He reckons it could be could be an option for sure worth a look. Although I mean I'm pretty sure he says that about any wave anytime but yeah fuck it and the man's looking sexy today baby.
131|Well, that's good to hear about yourself. You know, it's not you don't have to put it up there every time. It's good that you got out there. Graveyard wind just full dropped there. It was crazy. But then there was like fucking 15, 20 people, like stupid amount. So I was sat on the right for most of it and I get like five rights and then I'd go to the left and catch the set. And then I'd paddle on the inside, get like two rights and then paddle over, get a set on the left. And I was being a bit of a dog like that, but it worked pretty well. And the rights you just do literally just one cut back and that was it. But what I have found with this fin and which I'm really keen to investigate more is on when you're going when I'm going for like a slopeier section carve, I want my front foot, my back foot, sorry, to be like on the forward half of the deck on the grip pad. And then when you want to put it up there to have it all the way back, because I was finding my back foot would be like all the way on the kicker and I go for a carve and it'd be like too loose. But then if I did it with my back foot like halfway up the deck pad, then like it'd be real nice and feel like a sweet spot. So the sweet spot of the back foot was changing on the on the turn type, always changing the turn type because that finish is a bit looser, which is really interesting. And then I put it up there on the inside and last section back and put it up there. I was like pretty stoked in that favorite turn of the surf.
30|Oh, yeah, the boys were fucking last night bow up top, baby
26|You should definitely not spend the whole day programming on your anniversary as well. I can't imagine Nicole would be too impressed with that. Maybe you should go outside together or eat some food together like a dinner and have a conversation about life. Also, side note, not really a side note. Do you have any things about me having a guest over for dinner perhaps? After a surf later? I don't want to overstep inside your humble shed.
32|Benjamin, the time is 12.43 and all I've done today is work-wise is send an email, no just reply to a team's message from my phone and then send an email to both, oh I replied to them sponsoring me like a thank you message and then I sent an email about my chat with Steve and if they want me to ask anything more and that is fucking it and I haven't even been surfing I went and checked the waves and then I've just done fuck all crazy I hate Mondays so I think I'm gonna go surf lol
132|That's nice to hear you spoke to Blazer B. I haven't spoken to my parents since last Tuesday and not like Tuesday this week, I mean like the Tuesday before I went to Maricopa like fucking ages ago. Don't really know why or why not but that's just what it is and that is a very interesting business idea and if I was going to go into business with someone it would be you and I'd be keen to explore possibilities on how we could operate this with the huge caveat that I know fuck all about it but I can speak I reckon sometimes but that could be interesting very interesting indeed
126|Well, good or not, you've got me absolutely frothing to go surf again. You know, the froth levels kind of dipped this morning temporarily. Can confirm after spending five hours on shit that I didn't need to spend five hours on because I just wanted to do it. And when I told you that I was going to close Gemini, I didn't close Gemini. No, no, no. I carried on doing other shit I didn't need to do. But so I'm going to check the waves again.
33|Hey mate thought I'd give you a quick update. Um, fucking sun's out. Sun's out, currently 12.35. Locked into a nice early morning wake up. Got the fire fucking cranking. Coffee on, stretch done, yoga with Adrian. Did a um, some fucking flow one. She's a bit quick. Fucking absolutely ramster. I'm like, fuck it, hold on a minute. Let me get my fucking set up and then she's moving on. Know what I mean? Um, but yeah, feeling pretty mellow and then did lock into a fucking productive four hour session. Productivity was almost exceptional. Let's do the roof almost actually. It was, yeah it was. And now I'm at Graveyard. It's about um, oh there's my board. About um, so that's a good chest high. To bring you guys out. Light off shores by light I mean fucking hell and it's cunt off. But there's a few bangable ones out there I reckon. I think I'm about to absolute fucking, fucking bang him like last time you know. Get that fucking hip open in. Bang 12 o'clock. Bang 12 o'clock. And then I looked at flights, that flight to Brizzy, Brizzy Barley still to 50 bucks. So I'm gonna book that later. And how's the old visa situation? This is coach Clayton out.
